## Work Completed

Many pieces of the software are written. But they are not totally completed and all can use improvement.
 For example:

* Software framework for the front-end interface, server API and server-side processing.
* Relational database design.
* User management with 2-factor authentication and 3rd-party logins.
* User interface with navigation and dashboard.
* Component to transcribe a meeting recording using Google Speech Services.
* Component for a user to proofread transcribed text.
* Component to auto-process an existing city transcript and extract the information.
* Component for a user to assign issue tags to a meeting transcript.
* Framework in which to plug in features not yet implemented. 

You can see the user interface that is implemented so far, by clicking on "Boothbay Harbor" in the side menu.
This uses sample data from a small community in Maine, USA.
