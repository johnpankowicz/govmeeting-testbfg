  <h2> Speech Recognition</h2>

  <p> The more accurate the speech recognition, the less manual proofreading must be done.
     The software use the Google Speech API. Multi-speaker conversational speech is challanging.
      But the accuracy of the engine keeps improving.
  </p>
     <p>There are ways that we can improve the accuracy. </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
        We do not need to transcribe in real time. We can pre-process the audo to clirify it, remove extraneous sounds, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a number of techniques that Google provides to increase accuracy:
        speech adaptation, custom dictionaries, phrase collections, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>


  <h2> Transcript Processing</h2>

  <p> These transcripts need to be processed as follows. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Convert the transcipts from other formats (EG: PDF) into text files. * </li>
    <li> Extract information such as speaker and section names. * </li>
    <li> Put the information into a JSON format for further processing. * </li>

  </ul>

  <h3> Post processing </h3>

  <p> Whether the original information came from a recording or an exisiting transcript, the following post processing occurs. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Transform the data into an object representation that is used to populate a database. </li>
    <li> Provide a variety of ways to search, access and display the information. </li>
    <li> Accept personal search requests that it will store for a user and run against future data that it adds to the database. </li>
    <li> Alert users when their personal search requests yield results on new data. </li>
