 <h3> Mobile App that uses voice commands to fix errors </h3>

 <p>
   The <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']">Fix ASR</a> page shows a program for
   correcting errors in the generated text.
   A user needs to TYPE the corrections. This new feature would allow a user to SPEAK the corrections.
   A user would listen to the meeting and watch the scrolling generated text. At any time, they could
   SPEAK a correction.
 </p>
 <p>
   For example, suppose they hear "The street will be <b>paid</b> next week.". They could speak the correction
   by saying "will be <b>paved</b>". The software will use the start and/or ending words of the spoken correction
   as the "context" of the change. It this case, it would find "will be" in the immediate prior text and substitute
   the non-matching word "paved".

 </p>
 <p>
   "Speech recognition" is recognition of words of a single speaker. For a computer, this is much easier than conversional "voice recognition".
   The error rate for the spoken corrections should be much less than that of the original transcription.
 </p>

 <p>
   Users could use this method on smartphones and other mobile devices without keyboards.
