<h3>Re-arrange cards on the dashboard</h3>

Open the file: FrontEnd/ClientApp/src/app/dash-main/dash-main.html
<p>
You can change the position of any of the small cards or large card by
changing the position of the gm-small-card or gm-large-card elements in this file.
</p>

<h3> Add a new feature to a new card on the dashboard </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    At a terminal prompt, move to the folder: FrontEnd/ClientApp
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter: ng generate component your-feature
  </li>
  <li>
    Add your functionality to the files in : FrontEnd/ClientApp/src/app/your-feature
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert a new gm-small-card or gm-large-card element in dash-main.html.
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert the gm-your-feature element into the content area of the new card element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the icon, iconcolor, title and tooltip input attributes on the card element.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want the name of the currently selected location and agency in your controller:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add the location and agency input attributes to your element
      </li>
      <li>
        Add location and agency @Input properties in your controller. (See the other samples on dash-main.html)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Add a new Web API's </h3>

<h3> Add a new table to the database </h3>

<h3> Add more fields to the database for the logged in user</h3>

<p>
  Add properties to the class "ApplicationUser" in the file BackEnd\Database\DatabaseAccess_Lib\ApplicationUser.
  When the WebApp is restarted, new fields will be automatically generated in the database.
  After these changes are made in development and tested, an SQL change script can then be generated to update
  the production database.
</p>

<h3> Developer Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Dependency Injection - This is used throughout all projects. It allows components
    and subsystems to be stubbed out easily for develpment and testing.
    For example, in FrontEnd/ClientApp/src/app/app.module.ts,
    the services that call the Web API's in WebApp are currently replaced
    with stubs using DI. This allow the CLientApp to be developed without running
    WebApp. If you change the property "_isAspServerRunning" in this file from false to true,
    ClientApp will then call the Web API's to get data.
  </li>
  <li>
    The log files for WebApp and WorkflowApp are in the folder "logs" at the root of the solution.
    The file nlog-all-(date).log contain all the log messages including system.
    The file nlog-own-(date).log contain only the application messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the top of many of the component files in ClientApp, a const "NoLog" is defined.
    Change its value from true to false to turn on console logging for only that component.
    <br/>
    Log message are written in the form: "NoLog || console.log(this.ClassName + ...your.message....."
    "this.ClassName" displays the name of the component's class at the start of the message.
    If we were to put this boilerplate code in a wrapper function, the browser developer tools would always
    display the line number of the wrapper function as the line where the log message occurred.
  </li>
</ul>
