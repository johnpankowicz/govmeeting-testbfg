  <h2> Voice commands to fix errors </h2>

  <p>
    The <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']">Fix ASR</a> page shows a program for
    correcting errors in the generated text.
    A user needs to TYPE the corrections. This new feature would allow a user to SPEAK the corrections.
    A user would listen to the meeting and watch the scrolling generated text. At any time, they could
    SPEAK a correction.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, suppose they hear "The street will be <b>paid</b> next week.". They could speak the correction
    by saying "will be <b>paved</b>". The software will use the start and/or ending words of the spoken correction
    as the "context" of the change. It this case, it would find "will be" in the immediate prior text and substitute
    the non-matching word "paved".

  </p>
  <p>
    "Speech recognition" is recognition of words of a single speaker. For a computer, this is much easier than conversional "voice recognition".
    The error rate for the spoken corrections should be much less than that of the original transcription.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users could use this method on smartphones and other mobile devices without keyboards.
