  <mat-card-title>Overview</mat-card-title>

  Knowing what occurred at government public meetings gives us a very good overview of government activities.
  It is here where:
  <ul>
  <li> legislation is introduced</li>
  <li> bills are voted on </li>
  <li> formal department and committee reports are presented </li>
  <li> issues are discussed </li>
  <li> public comment occurs </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The debate and public comment can be the most instructive of all. Instead of reading all 500 pages of a new bill ourselves, it may be
    sufficient to hear the comments from those who have. Those in favor of the bill will present their most important reasons for favoring it.
    And those opposed will present their most important reasons for opposing it.
  </p>
<h2>Current Access </h2>

<p>
Getting access to this information is not easy for those who can't spend hours attending or watching meetings.
Transcripts are only available for a few much larger cities.
 And even these are usually difficult to obtain and more difficult to use.
</p>

<p>
  Here is a sample page from a Philadelphia transcript.
  It's 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It's in PDF format,
  making it unusable on small screens, since it can't adjust its size.
  Click: <button (click)="ToggleTranscript()"> {{showhidetranscript}} Sample Transcript </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowTranscript()" (click)="ToggleTranscript()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript page.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript page">
</p>
<p>
  Finding information is difficult. There is no table of contents. There is a computer generated single-word index.
  But it is meant for a legal researcher, not the average person. Click:
  <button (click)="ToggleIndex()"> {{showhideindex}} Sample Index </button>

<p>
  New York City is the largest city in the U.S. It produces transcripts of city council meetings. But trying to get them is not easy.
  Their website states that you need to go in person to the city clerk's office and pay $1 per page or $20 for an electronic copy.
