    <span class="L1">Government Body Registration</span>
    <p>
      An user may complete the registration for their local governing entities: (town, city, village, county, state, etc).
      When user register for the same location, they will see the data already entered. They
      can vote on the accuracy of any data items and specify alternate values. Votes will accumulate for each data value and the values
      with the most votes become the values that are on the official registration form that is used by the system.
