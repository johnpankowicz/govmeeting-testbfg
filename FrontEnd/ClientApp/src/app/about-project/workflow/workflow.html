<ol>
  <li> <span class="L1"> Individual Registration</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
      During registration, users specify their home location (town, city, village, postal code, etc).
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on their location, the system
        determines each of their governing entities (country, state, county, town/city etc)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Government Body Registration</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An user may complete the registration for their local governing entities:
        (town, city, village, county, state, etc).
      </li>
      <li>
        When another user registers for the same location, they will see the data already entered. They
        can vote on the accuracy of any data items and specify alternate values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Votes will accumulate for each data value and the values
        with the most votes become the values that are on the official registration form that is used by the system.

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1"> Import Recordings or Transcripts</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The system will download existing online recordings or transcripts on a regular schedule from
        the locations specified in the Government Body Registration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users have the option to upload recordings or transcripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many places neither provide transcripts nor recordings of their meetings.
        Govmeeting will provide a smartphome app that users can use to
        personally record and upload a meeting recording.
        <a href="https://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting/issues/18">Github issue #18</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Pre-process Existing Transcripts</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Convert transcripts to plain text. Often existing transcripts are in other formats like PDF.
         These are converted to plain text so that it is more easily processed.
      </li>
      <li> Extract information such as speaker and section names. </li>
      <li> Put the information into JSON format for further processing. </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1"> Transcribe Recordings Using Speech Recognition</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Convert recordings to the primary web video formats (mp4, ogg and webm.)
        This make them more accessable on all types of devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extract and merge audio tracks if more than one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload the audio file to Google Cloud storage to prepare for transcription.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call the asynchronous Google Speech API to do auto voice recognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Perform speaker change recognition. This is a Google API for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add speaker identification. This uses speech processing software on the server.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1"> Process Transcribed Text</span>
    <ul>
      <li> Split the video, audio and trancript files into 3 minute work segments,
        so that multiple volunteers can work simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li> Proofread text for errors. Provide a user friendly interface for quickly correcting errors.
        See: <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']"><strong>Proofread</strong></a>
      </li>
      <li> Extract information such as speaker and section names.</li>
      <li> Put the information into a JSON format for further processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>


  <li> <span class="L1"> Add issue tags</span>
    <ul>
    One of the most important jobs is correctly adding tags or metadata
    to the transcript. This is what enables:
    <ul>
      <li> information to be easily located. </li>
      <li> a transcript to be indexed and browsed quickly </li>
      <li> alerts to be set by user on specific issues </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        The names of issues need to assigned by people and not computers.
        This is the best way to ensure that they are meaningful.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is important that a very easy to use and quick user interface be provided.
        See: <a [routerLink]="['/addtags']"><strong>Add Tags</strong></a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Populate Relational Database</span>
    <br/> The data is put in a relational database so that it can be quickly
    accessed using multiple criteria.
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Data is now available for use</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A browe-able & search-able transcript is now available
      </li>
      <li>
        A summary of the issues discussed at the meeting is sent to those requesting it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alerts are sent on specific issues to those requesting it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Virtual meeting is arranged.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An agenda is created based on issues at the real meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Invitatations are sent to community members. Included are requests for possible additional agenda items.
      </li>
      <li>
        When responses are received, a ballot is sent to those who wil attend. On this ballot, members can vote on whether
        to include any of the suggested new agenda items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within a few days, a virtual meeting is held.
      </li>
  </ul>
  </li><br/>

  <li> <span class="L1">Workflow Management</span>
    <br/> Some of the above workflow steps are done automatically by the computer and some are done manually by volunteers.
         There are places in the workflow where a real person should verify that it is OK to proceed:
    <ul>
      <li> Verify that the URLs used to retrieve transcripts and recordings appear valid.  </li>
      <li> Verify that the content of the retrieved files appears valid. </li>
      <li> Verify that the output from the preprocessing appears valid. </li>
      <li> Verify that the speech to text conversion appears valid. </li>
      <li> Verify that the proofreading of the transcript appears completed. </li>
      <li> Verify that the adding of tags to the transcript appear completed. </li>
      <li> Verify the the final transcript data appears complete and valid. </li>
    </ul>
    There needs to be a way to elevate the rights of one or more of the location's registered users to a "manager" position.
    Managers would be notified whenever a decision is pending in the workflow.
    A manager could then log in and give or deny approval for the workflow to continue.
