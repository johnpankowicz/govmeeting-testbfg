[ This component needs to be written. ]
<p>
  This component will display a list of meetings for which manual processing is needed.
  This includes proofreading transcribed text or assigning issue tags.
</p>
<p>
  After a meeting is transcribed by Google Speach API,
   the video and matching text is split into short work segments.
   Different volunteers can then work simultaneously on proofreading
   the same meeting.
</p>
<p>
  A  list of the work items and their status will be displayed:
   "To be done", "In progress" or "Completed". Volunteers will be able to select a item to work on.
