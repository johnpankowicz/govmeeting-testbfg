Public Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy. They are where citizens present opposing views and come to consensus on decisions that affect us all. 
<p>In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business. In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.</p>
<p>Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people. Is this still democracy?</p>
<p>Meetings are sometimes broadcast on TV, for the few who watch them. Some newspapers report on some issues. But few people know much of what occurs.</p>
<p>The purpose of Govmeeting is give all citizens quick and easy access to what their public officials are doing and opportunities to affect their decisions.</p>

<h2>Problems with current access</h2>
<p>Getting access to this kind of information is difficult today. Only a few large cities make transcripts of their meetings available. And these are often difficult to obtain and use.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is the 6th largest city in the U.S. Here is a sample page from a Council transcript.
It's 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It's in PDF format, making it unusable on small screens, since the size can't be adjusted.</p>

<p>There is no table of contents. And the index is possibly usable by a legal researcher, but not the average person.</p>

<p>New York City is the largest city in the U.S. It also produces transcripts of city council meetings. But trying to get them is not easy. You need to file a request and pay $1 per page or $20 for an electronic copy of each meeting.</p>
<h2>The Focus</h2>
<p>The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But with today's technolgy, we may finally be able to create the tools we need.</p>
<p>Most other &quot;Open Government&quot; projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
It will use government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the data, it provides a way for citizens to create the data themselves.</p>
<p>Govmeeting's initial focus is on tools that work the best at the local level. Lessons learned there can help us build tools for the regional, state and country level.</p>
<p>Disillusion with democracy starts at the local level. Fixing this requires a grassroots effort at that level.</p>
<p>Govmeeting is  an  <a href="https://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting"> open source project on Github. </a></p>
