<p>Public Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy. They are where citizens present opposing views and come to consensus on decisions that affect us all.</p>
<p>In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business. In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.</p>
<p>Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people. Is this still democracy?</p>
<p>Meetings are sometimes broadcast on TV, for the few who watch them. Some newspapers report on some issues. But few people know much of what occurs.</p>
<p>The purpose of Govmeeting is give all citizens quick and easy access to what their public officials are doing and opportunities to affect their decisions.</p>

<h2>Problems with current access</h2>
<p>Getting access to this kind of information is difficult today. Only a few large cities make transcripts of their meetings available. And these are often difficult to obtain and use.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is the 6th largest city in the U.S. Here is a sample page from a Council transcript.
It's 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It's in PDF format, making it unusable on small screens, since the size can't be adjusted. There is also no table of contents. And the index is possibly usable by a legal researcher, but not the average person.</p>
