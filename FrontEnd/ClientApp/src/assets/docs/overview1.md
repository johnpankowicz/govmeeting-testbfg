Public Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy. They are where citizens present opposing views and come to consensus on decisions that affect us all. 

In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business. In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.

Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people. Is this still democracy? 

Meetings are sometimes broadcast on TV, bit few watch them. Some newspapers report on some issues. But few people know most of what transacts during these meetings.

There are many fine people who enter public office in order to improve their communities. But the current opaque system makes it too easy for others to use the office to benefit themselves. 

The purpose of Govmeeting is provide quick and easy access into official decisions that their representatives make and insight into what they mean.

## Features

Govmeeting will automatically:

* Retrieve online transcripts or recordings of government meetings.
* Transcribe the recordings using speech-to-text
* Process the transcripts into a standard format. 
* Load a relational database with the information in the transcripts

People will then be able to:

### Elect to receive after each meeting:

* A full transcript of the meeting.
* A summary of issues discussed.
* Alerts on specific issues.
* Alerts when a specific official speaks.
* Alerts on new proposed legislation.

### Go online and:

* Browse current and past meetings.
* Search meetings for issues discussed.
* Search for what a specific official said on issues.
* Search for voting results on legislation
* See statistics, graphs and charts on issues, legislature, etc.

A goal is for Govmeeting to work anywhere, in any language, for any form of representative government. The only requirement is that official meetings are open to the public or the transcripts are available.

## Problems with current access

Getting access to this kind of information is difficult today. Only a few large cities make transcripts of their meetings available. And these are often difficult to obtain and use.

Philadelphia is the 6th largest city in the U.S. Here is a sample page from a Council transcript.
It's 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It's in PDF format, making it unusable on small screens, since the size can't be adjusted. There is also no table of contents. And the index is possibly usable by a legal researcher, but not the average person.
