<p>New York City is the largest city in the U.S. It also produces transcripts of city council meetings. But trying to get them is not easy. You need to file a request and pay $1 per page or $20 for an electronic copy of each meeting.</p>
<h2>The Focus</h2>
<p>The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But with today's technolgy, we may finally be able to create the tools we need.</p>
<p>Most other &quot;Open Government&quot; projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
It will use government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the data, it provides a way for citizens to create the data themselves.</p>
<p>Govmeeting's initial focus is on tools that work the best at the local level. Lessons learned there can help us build tools for the regional, state and country level.</p>
<p>Disillusion with democracy starts at the local level. Fixing this requires a grassroots effort at that level.</p>
<p>Govmeeting is  an  <a href="https://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting"> open source project on Github. </a></p>
