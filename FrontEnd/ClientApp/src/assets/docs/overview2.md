New York City is the largest city in the U.S. It also produces transcripts of city council meetings. But trying to get them is not easy. You need to file a request and pay $1 per page or $20 for an electronic copy of each meeting.

## The Focus 

The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But with today's technolgy, we may finally be able to create the tools we need.

Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
It will use government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the data, it provides a way for citizens to create the data themselves.

Govmeeting's initial focus is on tools that work the best at the local level. Lessons learned there can help us build tools for the regional, state and country level.

Disillusion with democracy starts at the local level. Fixing this requires a grassroots effort at that level.

A goal is for Govmeeting to work anywhere, in any language, for any form of representative government. The only requirement is that official meetings are open to the public or that the transcripts are available.
