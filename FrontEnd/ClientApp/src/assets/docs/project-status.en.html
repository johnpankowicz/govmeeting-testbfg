<h1>Production Systems</h1>
<h2>Running a Govmeeting site</h2>
<p>Anyone can download the Govmeeting software and run it on their own servers or shared hosts.
This could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A government body itself</li>
<li>A citizen activist group</li>
<li>An individual citizen</li>
</ul>
<p>The scale and requirements of the installation will depend on size of the community it handles. This determines the potentail load on the system.</p>
<p>Requirements also depend on how much data will be saved. One option is to only save the processed transripts and the extracted data. Assume a transcript size of 20,000 words and average 6 character word size. An entire year of monthly town council meetings can fit into 1.5 meg of storage. This is a trivial amount of data</p>
<p>However, saving and hosting the video/audio of the meetings is another matter.
This would be needed to allow playback of selected sections of the meeting.
The stored transcript data contains the start/end time of every speakers' comments.
So that is a do-able feature and perhaps it is very useful.</p>
<h2>Govmeeting.org</h2>
<p>It would be helpful if a public site was available for those who
don't want install and maintain their own system. This also means that the collected data will not be under
their total control. So there is a trade-off to be made.</p>
<p>&quot;govmeeting.org&quot; is the current demo site for the software. It is now run on a low-cost shared host.
We can look into creating a non-profit that will own and operate this site. If many municipalities elect to use this site, it will need to be run on a cloud service like AWS or Azure, in order to dynamically increase capacity.</p>
