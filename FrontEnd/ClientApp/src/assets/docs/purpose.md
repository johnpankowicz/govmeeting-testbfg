## Democracy's Early Days

Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy.
They are where people of different opinions listen to each other,
present their points of view and try to work together toward common goals.

In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business.
In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.

## Challanges Today

Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people.
Is this still democracy?

Meetings today may be broadcast on local TV. But how many watch? Of those, how many watch the entire meeting?.

If we don't attend or watch, how do we find out what happened?
Sometimes minutes are available. But minutes don't record what's most important --
debate for and against proposed legislature.

Sometimes a news reporter is present.
But what parts does he/she report on? How accurate and unbiased is the reporting? How many people buy and read that newspaper.

Disenchantment with democracy starts at the local  level.
Even small town politicians know that an extremely small pecent of voters know what they are doing.
For democracy to work, the majority of citizens need to be involved on a continual basis.

Democracy is never easy. But it was easier 2,000 years ago, when only 50,000 needed to work together.
Today, hundreds of millions need to work together. 

## Solutions 

The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But with today's technolgy, we may finally be able to create the tools we need.

The purpose of Govmeeting is to build software so all can participate more in government.
The goal is to build something that can be used in any country on any level of government.

Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
It will use government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the data, it provides a way for citizens to create the data themselves.

Govmeeting's initial focus is on tools that work the best at the local level. Lessons learned there
can help us build tools for the regional, state and country level.
