## Democracy's Early Days

Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy.
They are where people of different opinions listen to each other,
present their points of view and try to work together toward common goals.

In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business.
In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.

Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people.
Is this still democracy?

## Challanges Today

Meetings today may be broadcast on local TV. But how many actually watch?
And of course, it is impossible to participate this way.

If we don't attend or watch, how do we find out what happened at them?
Sometimes minutes are available. But minutes don't record the most important part --
the passionate debate for and against proposed legislature. Sometimes a news reporter may be present.
But does he/she report on everything? And how accurate and unbiased are their reporting?

Disenchantment with democracy starts at the small local  level.
  Even small town politicians know that an extremely small pecent of their voters are watching what they do.
  For democracy to work, the majority of citizens need to be involved on a continual basis.

Democracy is never easy. But it was easier 2,000 years ago when only 50,000 needed to work together.
Today, hundreds of millions need to work together. Each of us needs to participate at multiple goverment levels: for our town, our region,our state and our country.

## Solutions 

The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But today with technolgy, we may finally are able to
create tools that can can allow hundreds of millions to work together.

The purpose of Govmeeting is to build software that enables everyone to actively participate in government.
The goal is to build something generic enough that it can be used in any country on any level of government.

Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
It will use government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the needed
data, it provides a way for citizens themselves to create the data that they need to monitor government actions.

The workings of democracy need to be learned first at the grassroot level - in towns, villages and small cities.
  It is only if democracy can succeed at the grassroots level, that there is any hope of it succeeding at higher levels.

Govmeeting's initial primary focus is on tools that work the best at the local level. Lessons learned there
can help us fashion the tools we need at the regional, state and country level.
