00:12:48 >> APPLAUSE.
00:12:49 >> MY NAME IS LAURA BROWN, MICHELLE SMITH IS MY
00:12:54 ALDERMAN. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE HORSE CARRIAGES
00:12:59 HAVE NO PLACE -- CHICAGO DOESN'T WANT THESE DANGEROUS --
00:13:08 ON OUR STREETS AND THERE'S MORE WEALTHY ACTIVITIES FOR
00:13:12 OUR TOURISTS. HORSES ARE SENSITIVE AND SKITTISH.
00:13:18 ANIMALS AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED WHEN THEY ARE
00:13:22 SPOOKED. THERE ARE 324 VIOLATIONS IN CHICAGO. AND A
00:13:30 CONTINUAL STREAM OF VIOLATIONS SINCE THEN. THERE ARE
00:13:35 VIOLATIONS, AND NEARLY ALL BUSINESSES WILL BE SHUT DOWN
00:13:39 IF THEY BEHAVE IN THIS FASHION. A HORSE WITH TERRIBLE
00:13:45 SORES WAS FOUND AND THIS TO BE REMOVED IN THE STREETS,
00:13:49 EVERY TIME I HAVE FREE TIME, I NOTICE CLEAR VIOLATIONS
00:13:53 THE LAW. LAST SUMMER I PERSONALLY WITNESSED AND FILMED
00:14:01 A HORSE DRIVING THROUGH LIGHTNING AND STORM ON CITY
00:14:07 AVENUE. WE DO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE COMMENTS --
00:14:22 LOST AUDIO. STAND BY. HE DID NOT USE THE WORD
00:14:58 DEFECATE. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE END TRUSTED
00:15:00 WITH THE CARE OF THESE HORSES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR
00:15:04 CITY, I DON'T KNOW IF TIEING A HORSE'S TAIL IS ILLEGAL,
00:15:07 BUT IT IS INHUMANE AS IT PREVENTS -- LOST AUDIO, STAND
00:15:13 BY. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS LEGISLATION TO
00:15:26 BANNED THIS ARCHAIC PRACTICE. OUR TOURISTS BEING SENT
00:15:31 TO THE HOSPITAL, IF YOU'RE SICK OF OUR LETTERS AND PHONE
00:15:35 CALLS, PASS THE BANNED, WE ARE GROWING IN NUMBERS, AND
00:15:38 WE WILL GET IT ENACTED. ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN THE
00:15:43 HUMANE OR INHUMANE SIDE OF CHICAGO. THANKS SO MUCH.
00:15:47 >> THANK YOU MS. BROWN, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MAY TOY.
00:15:55 >> HELLO. MY NAME IS, MAY TOY. I'M HERE TODAY TO
00:16:07 SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT -- OUR NEEDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:16:12 IT'S LOCATED IN THE [INAUDIBLE]. AS YOU KNOW THE CITY
00:16:16 ANNEX HAS TO BE PART OF DOWNTOWN. THE PROBLEM IS, WE'RE
00:16:22 STILL A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS IN NEED. BECAUSE IT WAS
00:16:25 CALLED DOWNTOWN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT
00:16:29 WE STILL HAVE BASIC NEEDS IN TERMS -- I'VE BEEN A
00:16:41 PRESIDENT FOR OUR COUNSEL FOR 20 YEARS. WHEN I BECAME A
00:16:45 PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME, IT SERVED OUR COMMUNITY. TEN
00:16:50 YEARS AGO, BASED ON THE CENSUS, I DID ANOTHER ANALYSIS,
00:16:55 AND IT SAYS THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD LACKED THE 33 ACRES OF
00:17:00 GREEN SPACES. NOW, ANOTHER TEN YEARS HAS PASSED, I AM
00:17:05 SURE WITH THE NEW CENSUS, IT WILL SHOW WITH THE ADDED
00:17:08 DEVELOPMENT THE CITY COUNSEL HAS A PROBLEMED FOR OUR
00:17:12 COMMUNITY, WE WILL LACK FOR IT, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:17:17 NOT IN THE NEAR WEST SIDE COMMUNITY AREA, JUST IN THE
00:17:22 WEST -- SO HERE I'M SAYING TO YOU; OKAY, I AM GLAD THAT
00:17:27 I SEEN THE NEWS REPORTS THAT YOU DO NOT SUPPORT SELLING
00:17:33 OFF CITY ASSETS, I'M HERE TO SAY TO YOU THAT WE NEED TO
00:17:37 EXPAND [INAUDIBLE], INTO THE OLD -- CURRENT ACTUALLY,
00:17:42 POLICE TRAINING ACADEMY TO FULFILL THE NEEDS TO OUR
00:17:48 COMMUNITY. I PROPOSE FOR IT TO SERVE AS A COMMUNITY
00:17:52 CENTER, TO SERVE AS A COMMUNITY. OKAY. AND SO EVERYONE
00:18:00 UNDERSTANDS, NOT EVERYONE IS RICH. DIRECTLY ACROSS IS A
00:18:06 HUB HOUSING. A BLOCK AWAY, THERE'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS
00:18:12 HOME. EVERYBODY EQUAL, IN A PUBLIC PARK. YOU KNOW, AND
00:18:20 WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
00:18:23 THE WEST LOOK. THERE'S A GAMETE OF PIMA CROSS ALL AGES
00:18:28 AND ECONOMIC NEEDS. IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL OF THESE RICH
00:18:32 PEOPLE LIVING IN ALL OF THESE MILLION DOLLAR CONDOS
00:18:36 BEING BUILT, WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE
00:18:40 DOWNTOWN DESTINATION FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
00:21:03 >> [INAUDIBLE].
00:21:04 >> TO 85 PERCENT WILL ENSURE THAT MORE OWNERS ARE IN
00:21:08 AGREEMENT WITH THE SELL. THIS POTENTIAL INCREASE CAN
00:21:12 HAVE UNINTENDED DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES AND BUILDINGS
00:21:17 OF OUR SIZE AND PROFILE, INVESTORS WHO ARE TARGETED IN
00:21:23 DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS, INCLUDING OURBLE ARE ACTIVELY
00:21:28 SEEKING THE MARKET, PRIOR TO THE VOTE TO ENSURE THAT
00:21:32 THEY HAVE A SAY IN THE VOTE. EVEN IF TEN OR 15 PERCENT
00:21:37 OWNERSHIP THEY CAN CAUSE ENORMOUS DE-STRESS IN THE
00:21:43 BUILDING. THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH TAKE OVER THE BOARD
00:21:47 ESPECIALLY IN THE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE HIGH INVESTMENT,
00:21:51 AND THE -- IS VERY LOW. SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY
00:21:56 REACH THE 15 PERCENT MARK? THE INABILITY TO STOP THEM.
00:22:01 THEY WILL PUT A BUILDING UNTIL A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. AND
00:22:10 IT'S FOR THE PURPOSE TO TRY TO ACHIEVE FROM BEING KICKED
00:22:16 OUT OF THE RESIDENTS WILL RESULT IN A COMPLETE -- THEY
00:22:24 WILL BE KICKED OUT IN THE VERSIONS THAT'S IN HE SENSE IN
00:22:29 A BELOW MARKET PRICES, PUSH IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. AND
00:22:36 SOLICIT IT'S -- [INAUDIBLE].
00:22:39 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. MARK, LOVELESS.
00:22:45 >> GOOD MORNING, MADAM MAYOR. THAT FELT SO GOOD, I'LL
00:23:10 SAY IT AGAIN, MADAM MAYOR. I WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE
00:23:14 THE WORK THAT YOU, UM, AND THE CLERK AND OTHERS HAVE
00:23:20 DONE IN LOOKING AT RELIEVING AND REORGANIZING THE
00:23:23 PARKING TICKET STRUCTURE AND PROGRAM. UM, THERE'S ONE
00:23:27 LAST STEP THAT I WILL YOU TO CONSIDER. WE'RE THE ONLY
00:23:42 ONES IN AMERICA TO HAVE THIS TAX. AND THE ONLY ONE IN
00:23:47 THE REGION I ASK THAT THE FINAL STEP BE DONE AND TO LOOK
00:23:51 AT OTHER WAYS TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN AND INCREASE THE
00:23:54 QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE HERE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO.
00:23:58 INCREASING THE QUALITY OF LIFE WITH THINGS SUCH AS
00:24:01 THINGS LIKE, YESTERDAY WITH ALDERMAN PAT D O W, AND WE
00:24:09 HAVE MORE COMING, AND HER SUPPORT, AND ALDERMAN KING
00:24:12 SUPPORT, WE'RE TRANSFORMING OUR COMMUNITIES MORE
00:24:17 COMMUNITY MINDED. SO WE CAN MAKE CHICAGO NOT JUST THE
00:24:21 CITY THAT'S SHINING ON THE HILL, BUT THE VALLEY
00:24:25 SURROUNDED. AROUND THOSE LINES THERE'S ONE MORE PIECE
00:24:29 THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT. THAT'S THE
00:24:32 FUNDING REGARDING H I V AND AIDS, AND THE L G B T Q
00:24:38 COMMUNITY, AND THE L S COMPANY UNIT. IN THIS BUDGET
00:24:44 PROPERTY I HOPE THAT YOU STRESS THE EQUITY ISSUES, I
00:24:49 KNOW THERE'S CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOLDING THIS MONEY UP
00:24:53 AND DOING THIS. LOOK, THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND
00:24:56 THE BLACK COMMUNITY I V AND AIDS, WE'RE IN A
00:25:03 DISPROPORTION FOR THIS. LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC
00:25:06 OPPORTUNITIES AS FAR AS PROVIDING -- USING THE HOUSING,
00:25:11 UM, UM, RESOURCE CENTER AVAILABLE. ALL OF THESE THINGS
00:25:15 BUT -- NOT -- I ASK YOU NOT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PLAY
00:25:20 POLITICAL GAINS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES, WE HAVE BEEN THERE
00:25:24 TOO LONG, AND BEEN THERE TOO LONG AND SUFFERED TOO LONG,
00:25:28 AND WE HAVE TOO MUCH OPTIMISTIC OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN
00:25:32 ELIMINATE H I V AND AIDS, TOTALLY IN THIS CITY, WE CAN
00:25:37 ELIMINATE IT, IF WE CAN ALL TAKE THE SERIOUS WORK AT
00:25:41 HAND AND NOT, UM, AND NOT GET LOST IN POLITICAL GAME
00:25:47 PLAY, AND THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
00:25:49 >> THANK YOU MR. LOVELESS FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
00:25:56 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FISHER
00:26:06 >> HELLO. DEAR HONORABLE LIGHTFOOT AND ALL CITY
00:26:11 COUNSEL MEMBERS. GOD BLESS YOU. AND EACH PERSON
00:26:16 SITTING HERE TO BRING OUT THE BEST CHICAGO. WE CAN BE
00:26:20 WORKING TOGETHER. I HAVE NO SMALL TASK FOR YOU. I AM
00:26:25 ASKING THAT THE CITY OF CHICAGO RESTORE STAR LIGHT OVER
00:26:28 THE CITY. LIGHT POLLUTION IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM. CHICAGO
00:26:34 REMAINS THE POSTER CHILD FOR LIGHT POLLUTION IN SPITE OF
00:26:39 THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS FROM SCIENTISTS OF
00:26:43 ALL DIFFERENT FIELDS AGREEING ON A CONSENSUS THAT OUR
00:26:47 LIGHT POLLUTION WILL INCREASE THE HEALTH RISK TO THE
00:26:52 PEOPLE INCLUDING BREAST, PROSTATE, CANCER, COLON CANCER,
00:27:01 MOOD DISORDERS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION, AND AGGRESSION,
00:27:04 AND SUICIDES. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO THAT CHICAGO
00:27:17 REMAINS THE MOST VIOLENT PLACE. RECENTLY, LINCOLN PARK
00:27:25 ZOO WORKED TOGETHER WITH OTHER TWO UNIVERSITIES, AND
00:27:33 OTHER STATES TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF CHICAGO'S WATER
00:27:41 POLLUTION WILD LIFE. AND THEY FOUND THAT IT IS
00:27:48 DETRIMENTAL. AND IT IS TWICE CONTAGIOUS, I NOW LIVE IN
00:28:00 A POLLUTED AREA. PLEASE, THERE'S THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS
00:28:05 AND REASONS AS TO WHY WE NEED TO MINIMIZE LIGHT
00:28:10 POLLUTION AND ALSO, UM, THE ISSUE -- LOST AUDIO, STAND
00:28:14 BY. -- THAT CAN DO THIS, M A STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT
00:28:28 WE MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE BLUE RICH STREET -- LOST AUDIO,
00:28:33 STAND BY. -- OF THE RIVER. WE CAN DO EVERYTHING. THIS
00:28:47 IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE, EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN
00:28:49 THIS LIFE AND EVEN THE UNBORN IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER. I

00:28:58 >> YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED.
00:29:01 >> YOUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MS., E R N A S T I N E.
00:29:11 >> GOOD MORNING. MAYOR LIGHTFOOT. AND COUNSEL MEN
00:29:15 AND WOMEN. I'M A DESCENDANT OF RUSTLE MAIN. I'M ALSO
00:29:28 PRESIDENT OF THE PROGESTEROID LIFE FEDERATION. I'M A
00:29:33 MEMBER OF THE U N I A, LOCAL, 401 MARCUS G A R.V. Y,
00:29:43 INSTITUTE. SO NOW I CAME IN WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
00:29:47 FLAG, I AM VERY PROUD TO UM, CARRY THE FLAG. I KNOW I
00:29:53 WITNESSED HERE ABOUT TWO SUMMERS AGO. -- LAST AUDIO.
00:29:57 STAND BY. MINUTE MITCH I WANTED TO CARRY IT, BUT THIS
00:31:14 MAN BEHIND ME TOOK IT FROM ME. AND THAT'S SOMETHING
00:31:18 THAT I DON'T LIKE. THAT HAPPENED TO A FRIEND OF MINE
00:31:22 WHO OWNS A STORE. THE POLICE TOLD HER TO TAKE THE FLAG
00:31:29 DOWN. LOST AUDIO: WE ARE ASKING FOR REPARATIONS AS FAR
00:31:46 AS CITY COUNSEL STARTING THE REPARATION. IT WAS ONE OF
00:31:51 THE ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SO THE MOVEMENT
00:31:54 CAN START WITH A SIMPLE THEY CAN AS HIM NOT TAKING MY
00:31:58 FLAG I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD MY FLAG STANDING HERE, JUST
00:32:03 LIKE YOU HAVE THE CHICAGO AND THE AMERICAN FLAG, THAT'S
00:32:07 THE CULTURE OF MY HAIR /TAPBL. I SPOKE, K A L.A. B A.
00:32:20 >> THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THE SCENE OF THE
00:32:31 ACCIDENT SPEAKER IS MS. D O R R I S.
00:32:38 >> GOOD MORNING, MAYOR, LIGHTFOOT. THIS IS THE REPORT
00:33:01 ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE REPARATION. IN ADDITION, TO
00:33:09 THAT I AM A CHICAGO TEACHER AND COUNSELOR. AND I HAVE
00:33:13 SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE RACIAL DISPARITY WITHIN
00:33:19 THE CHICAGO BOARD OF EDUCATION. BLACK CHILDREN, BLACK
00:33:24 CHILDREN MAKE A 36 PERCENT OF THE C P S POPULATION.
00:33:29 BLACK EMPLOYEES, AND TEACHERS, MAKE UP ONLY 20 PERCENT.
00:33:35 WHITE STUDENTS REPRESENT TEN PERCENT IN THE SYSTEM AND
00:33:38 THE WHITE TEACHERS ARE 50 PERCENT. THAT'S A GROSS
00:33:44 DISPARITY. CHICAGO TEACHER'S UNION IS TALKING ABOUT
00:33:52 HIRING NEW COUNSELORS AND NEW NURSES. OUT OF THOSE, WE
00:33:57 NEED MORE BLACK NURSES, WE NEED MORE BLACK COUNSELORS,
00:34:02 WE NEED MORE BLACK PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OCCUPATIONAL
00:34:09 THERAPISTS, SPEECH THERAPISTS ACROSS THE BOARD. STUDY
00:34:14 AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT IF A BLACK STUDENT HAS A BLACK
00:34:22 TEACHER HAS 15 PERCENT CHANCES OF GOING TO COLLEGE. IF
00:34:28 HE HAS, 2 TEACHERS, IT GOES UP 30 PERCENT. THIS CANNOT
00:34:34 CONTINUE IN THE SYSTEM, AND I WANT THIS BODY TO
00:34:38 SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION AS IT GOES THROUGH
00:34:42 THE PROCESS. AND I AM HOPING THAT THIS RESOLUTION IF
00:34:45 NOT BEFORE, WE CAN END THIS RACIAL DISPARITY WITHIN THE
00:34:49 CITY OF CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:34:56 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS MS. LEWIS. THE NEXT
00:35:00 SPEAKER IS -- THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. M A U R I C E. IN

00:37:15 AREA, THEY WILL LOSE TAX REVENUES BY ELIMINATING
00:37:19 EXISTING REVENUES IN FIVE BUSINESS SERVICES. THE
00:37:22 PLANNING IDEA TO ELIMINATE THE BUSINESSES IS
00:37:29 UNPRECEDENTED IN ANY P M.D. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS
00:37:33 PROVIDED NO PROOF THAT IT HAS ANY NEGATIVISM PACT IN THE
00:37:37 INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES. THE FACT THAT THE IDEA OF THE
00:37:40 DEMODERNIZING PUNISHES A LOT OF P M.D. EMPLOYEES IN THE
00:37:46 WEST SIDE RESIDENTIALS WHO WILL LOSE CRITICAL SERVICES
00:37:49 NEARBY MUCH THE VOTE TODAY IS THE MAYOR'S PLEDGE TO
00:38:08 END -- NOW, MAYOR LIGHTFOOT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE
00:38:13 QUESTION IS YOURS, WILL YOU ALLOW ONE ALDERMAN TO DECIDE

00:44:08 >> ALDERMAN SMITH.
00:44:09 >> THANK YOU. THIS IS A SAD MOMENT AND REMEMBRANCE
00:44:13 FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO KNOW MICHAEL THROUGHOUT HIS
00:44:17 PROFESSIONAL CAREER, I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT HE WAS A
00:44:20 LONG-TERM RESIDENT OF OUR WARD, AND IT IS HARD TO HONOR
00:44:24 A GUY WHO -- A HARD THING TO IMAGINE. WHO RAISED THEIR
00:44:39 CHILDREN AT THE BACK OF THE STORE AND THEN OVER THE
00:44:41 STORE, AND INSTILL THEM: AND WAS A TREMENDOUS LEADER IN
00:44:58 REALIZING THAT EVERY CONSTITUENCY NEEDS POWER AND THE
00:45:03 WAY TO GET POWER IS TO ORGANIZE. LOST AUDIO. STAND BY.
00:45:36 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR LIFE IS TO HAVE THE

00:45:50 >> ALDERMAN CAPPLEMAN.
00:45:55 >> THANK YOU, I DO STAND IN SUPPORT -- LOST AUDIO,
00:46:01 STAND BY. MICHAEL SPOKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ABOUT HIS
00:46:17 DEEP LOVE FOR YOU, AND I THINK FOR THE L G B T
00:46:21 COMMUNITY, IT'S SO IMPORTANT, IT CERTAINLY STRENGTHENED
00:46:24 MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND, WITH BOTH YOU AND
00:46:30 MICHAEL BEING SO OPEN ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP, I THINK
00:46:33 THAT IT HELPED THE CITY OF CHICAGO TO UNDERSTAND THAT
00:46:36 THE DEEP LOVE THAT WE CAN HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER, YOU
00:46:40 PAVED THE WAY.
00:46:51 >> THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
00:46:56 RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION, I MET MICHAEL DURING
00:47:00 MY YEARS AS COUNTY COMMISSIONER, I REMEMBER HIM BEING
00:47:05 VERY ENERGETIC AND VERY HAPPY, AND I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY
00:47:17 IN MY LIFE WHO LOVES POLITICS AS MUCH AS HE DID. ALL OF
00:47:23 US GET TO A POINT -- LOST AUDIO:
00:47:39 >> ALDERMAN BURR?
00:47:44 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM PRESIDENT, I WOULD ALSO
00:47:47 LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HIS RESOLUTION. I HAVE KNOWN
00:47:51 MICHAEL MY WHOLE CAREER. HE WAS ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN. HE
00:48:18 BROUGHT A LOT OF HAPPINESS TO THE COUNSEL AND
00:48:20 SPRINGFIELD AND WASHINGTON AND EVERYWHERE THAT HE WENT,
00:48:24 MY CON TO YOU.
00:48:35 >> IF YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH MICHAEL AND ROGER -- LOST
00:48:57 AUDIO. IF HE WAS AGAINST YOU, HE WOULD SMILE AND WALK
00:49:08 UP AND TELL YOU HE WAS AGAINST YOU, AND HE WOULD BRING
00:49:11 IT, BUT HE DID SO TO COME UP WITH WHAT'S GOOD PUBLIC
00:49:15 POLICY AND WHAT'S RIGHT AND HE STOOD BY HIS FRIENDS, AND
00:49:19 HE JOINED THE BATTLE AND POLITICS CAN BE ROUGH. BUT HE
00:49:26 BROUGHT -- IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR CITY, AND OUR
00:49:41 COUNTRY, MICHAEL WAS ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT. AND
00:49:44 HE WAS ALWAYS PART OF ADVANCING THAT, AND TALKING TO
00:49:50 PEOPLE ABOUT WHO HE WAS AND THE POLICIES AND HOW THEY
00:49:53 AFFECTED PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T BE THERE TO SPEAK FOR
00:49:57 THEM. HE WAS THEIR VOICE AND ALI. AND HE WILL BE
00:50:01 DEEPLY REMEMBERED.
00:50:02 >> THANK YOU. ALDERMAN TUNNEY.
00:50:05 >> THANK YOU MAYOR. I'M READING THE RESOLUTION, AND
00:50:09 UM, I THINK THAT YOU AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH
00:50:17 MIKE, NOT JUST THE YEARS THAT WE KNEW HIM, HE WAS THE
00:50:20 CAMPAIGN FINANCE CLAIR, AND CO CHAIR. AND FOR MY FIRST,
00:50:25 ALDERMAN SUCCESSFUL CANDIDACY. HE WAS SO PROUD OF YOU
00:50:32 AND SUPPORTED YOU FROM DAY ONE. WE HAD A GREAT SERVICE
00:50:36 IT WAS LONG I THINK THAT WE HAD ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL
00:50:41 PERSON FROM SENATOR D U R B A N. ALL THE WAY UP TO THE
00:50:48 44TH FLOOR, AND WE SHARED THIS LOVE FOR MICHAEL AND
00:50:53 ROGER, AND I WAS AMAZED AT THE SERVICE AT THE NIECES HOW
00:50:58 ARTICULATE THEY WERE ABOUT THEIR UNCLES, BECAUSE BOTH
00:51:03 SIDES SPOKE TO ELOQUENTLY FOR THEIR LOVE OF MICHAEL, I
00:51:08 LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HIS FAMILY HISTORY TO REALIZE THAT
00:51:12 HIS PARENTS LOST EVERYBODY IN THE HOLOCAUST THAT THEY
00:51:21 CAME TO AMERICA FATHER WAS A SHOPKEEPER I BELIEVE, AND I
00:51:26 THINK THAT'S SOME OF MIKE'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP. BUT HE
00:51:33 SHARE SO MANY LASTING TEARS TOGETHER. AND HE'S GOING TO
00:51:36 BE MISSED. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS INSANE
00:51:43 FOR THAT MATTER, BECAUSE HE HAD ROGER AT HOME, BECAUSE
00:51:47 ROGER STAYED OUT OF THE POLITICS, BUT HE KEPT MICHAEL
00:51:52 BALANCED AND LOVED AND CHERISHED. AND I KNOW THAT
00:51:57 YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE AIRLINES, AND I KNOW THAT YOU
00:52:00 SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING, AND CHICAGO IS YOUR HOME,
00:52:04 AND LAKE VIEW, AND LINCOLN PARK, AND OUR LOVE AND
00:52:08 AFFECTION IS FOR YOU ROGER, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN
00:52:13 SOMEONE IS SENDING THEIR CONDOLENCES. AND I KNOW THAT
00:52:18 YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS, BOTH YOURS AND OURS,
00:52:23 AND MICHAEL'S WILL ENDURE FOR A LONG LONG TIME.
00:52:27 >> ALDERMAN RILEY?
00:52:29 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. UM, I TOO RISE IN
00:52:34 SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. MICHAEL B O W E R WAS A
00:52:39 FRIEND AND SOMEONE I WILL MISS VERY MUCH, WE LOST
00:52:43 MICHAEL, CHICAGO LOST A FANTASTIC CIVIC LEADER. MY
00:52:48 EXPERIENCE WITH MICHAEL OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS WAS THAT
00:52:51 HE WAS VERY DIRECT AND HONEST, AND FIERCELY LOCAL, AND
00:52:57 SOMEONE THAT YOU WANT ON YOUR TEAM AND NOT ON THE OTHER,
00:52:59 AND HE WAS A FOUNTAIN OF GREAT ADVICE FOR ME AND UM,
00:53:03 WHEN I WAS IN A TOUGH SPOT, MY FIRST TERM, I TURNED TO
00:53:09 MICHAEL FOR ADVICE AND HE ALWAYS -- LOST AUDIO. HE TOLD
00:53:25 ME I WAS CRAZY, AND THAT I SHOULDN'T RUN, AND I DID IT
00:53:29 ANY WAY, AND AFTERWARDS, HE CAME AND SAW ME, I'M GLAD
00:53:34 THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE ADVICE. HE HELPED GUIDE ME IN
00:53:38 MY TERM OF OFFICE. I'M REALLY SORRY ROGER FOR YOUR
00:53:46 LOSS. HE'S A PERSON TO BE MISSED FOR A LONG LONG TIME.
00:53:49 >> I ALSO STAND FOR THE ENTIRE BODY TO SPEAK ON THIS
00:53:56 RESOLUTION. MICHAEL WAS MY DEAR FRIEND AND CON. I WILL
00:54:09 ALWAYS LOVE HIM DEARLY. HE REALLY WAS ONE OF A KIND.
00:54:15 HE WAS A PASSIONATE HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE AND POLITICAL
00:54:30 ADVOCATE. IT IS BECAUSE OF MICHAEL -- IT WAS SOMETHING
00:54:43 THAT ENDED 7 YEARS BEFORE HE WAS BORN. TO KNOW MICHAEL,
00:54:47 WAS TO KNOW HOW TRULY THAT WAS. THE REALITY OF THE
00:54:51 HOLOCAUST AND THE HORROR, AS MICHAEL HIMSELF SAID MANY
00:55:06 TIMES, IF IT HAD HAPPENED, IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN, MAYBE
00:55:10 NOT TO JEWS BUT TO ANOTHER GROUP. YOU SAW HIM FELT THAT
00:55:19 URGENCY IN FIGHTING ABORTION RIGHTS, AND HOLOCAUST, AND
00:55:28 HOW HE FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE L G B T Q COMMUNITY,
00:55:33 WHERE HE WAS A PROUD OUT MEMBER. TO FIGHT, WAS ALSO HIS
00:55:40 WAY OF CARRYING OUT HIS PARENTS LEGACY. AT ITS CORE,
00:55:46 HIS LIFE WAS A FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE. BUT IF
00:55:51 THERE'S ANYTHING THAT BEST CAPTURED MICHAEL AND WHO HE
00:55:55 WAS IT WAS SEEING HIM WITH HIS BE LOVED ROGER. AS
00:56:01 MICHAEL HIMSELF SAID, BEING WITH ROGER, IS SHOWING
00:56:07 PEOPLE WHO WILL A GAY COUPLE LOOKED LIKE. AND IT WAS
00:56:11 SHOWING A ZEST FOR LIFE AND A JOY HE CARRIED. THE YOUNG
00:56:24 PEOPLE HE MENTORED AND HIS SUCCESS IN CREATING A CITY
00:56:29 AND COUNTY, THAT WAS MORE FAIR AND DECENT AND JUST.
00:56:32 ROGER, AS I TOLD YOU, I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO MAKE
00:56:37 SURE THAT MICHAEL'S LEGACY AND MEMORY LIVE ON. THANK
00:56:42 YOU.
