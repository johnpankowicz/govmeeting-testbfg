0:56
you added came out very well that's
0:58
coming up in a couple of weeks second
1:02
bit of information is just all the
1:03
Christmas lights for the festival of
1:05
lights have arrived at public works for
1:07
both boothbay harbor and whose baby is
1:10
going to pick up there is this week
1:11
later on this week we're going to go
1:13
over the public start sorting it out and
1:14
setting it up as per how it's going to
1:17
be laid out through the town so that's
1:19
that's gonna be quite a task as 23,000
1:21
light so that will keep you busy
1:25
the other night at the opera house when
1:29
we had the meeting with green tree I
1:31
brought up the fact that we still have
1:33
one position open on the boothbay side
1:35
of the Joint Economic Development
1:36
Committee that membership and i have one
1:41
application in hand from john dunn
1:43
searched you may know from the board of
1:45
appeals and planning board at four
1:48
o'clock this afternoon Jeff teal come in
1:50
and got an application as well so I'm
1:51
expecting another one to come in and I
1:54
know when you mentioned maybe advertised
1:56
it for another week and see I don't know
1:57
if that's still something you want to
1:59
move or
2:00
uh honey c c11 rockstar retreats not to
2:05
your second
2:07
yeah so yes we could that be great
2:10
little bit that if we don't have any
2:11
morning and just look at those two all
2:13
right thank you
2:14
yeah sure as you know we have been down
2:18
one shellfish warden for a month month
2:21
and a half we ran the ad for a full
2:23
month and got no applications Nick up
2:26
who was our previous shellfish warden
2:29
has stepped up and volunteered to resume
2:32
my position would like so I would ask
2:35
the board to the point Nick up and
2:38
shellfish water
2:39
ok i'll look for a motion so moved and a
2:42
second second on paper
2:48
thank you should also have from Bob
2:52
fonts a memorandum regarding the flood
2:57
project oversight committee bob has made
3:01
some recommendations for people if you
3:03
would like to have pointed to that
3:04
committee and those are myself
3:09
Jeff Curtis a local property owner
3:11
Ramsey lafayette property owner Chris
3:14
Leaman from public works
3:16
jeff smith the code enforcement officer
3:17
scott campbell with the ma build Hamlin
3:21
of the Planning Board Mike tomko
3:23
selectmen and grandchildren local
3:26
businessman Bob fonts himself obviously
3:28
because he's the project manager and a
3:30
gentleman named Pete slovensky those are
3:33
the main geological survey so I told Bob
3:36
that I would ask the board to appoint
3:39
those people to those positions this
3:41
evening
3:42
ok so all the promotion to a point
3:45
though i move that we . this list of
3:48
people to the boothbay order flood
3:52
project committee a second okay
3:55
any discussion No seeing none all paper
3:59
ok motion carries
4:01
penis I'm on the list and last but not
4:06
least how you should also have a scope
4:09
of work from favorite solvents regarding
4:13
the footbridge as you know last Tuesday
4:16
as Public Works was expecting it
4:18
frequently discovered a rotten joists
4:21
underneath the swing span of the bridge
4:24
it was not visibly saying you had to
4:27
crawl underneath the deck of the swing
4:29
span to to see it but there's a 6 x 12 x
4:33
23 foot beam that's completely
4:36
compromised at this point and so at that
4:41
point I asked public works to get
4:43
someone down here from marine building
4:45
companies are representative from proc
4:47
marine came down as you know and the
4:50
recommendation that day was to shut the
4:52
footbridge down which we did do
4:53
unfortunately before columbus day
4:56
weekend we also had the next day we
5:01
asked for an engineering company to come
5:03
down to take a look at it give us their
5:05
opinions on that and i'll go over some
5:07
of what they have provided here for that
5:09
the same day we also had represented
5:12
from Maine Municipal Association here
5:14
which is our insurance carrier so
5:15
they're aware of the issue and what what
5:21
transpired last week was Nick up from
5:24
Christian myself and the two
5:27
representatives from Baker consultants
5:29
and went out to the swing portion of the
5:32
superstructure and the professional
5:37
opinion given the condition of what's
5:38
underneath the swing span is that that
5:41
entire swing span section should be
5:43
replaced
5:44
you can tell in previous years that some
5:47
of the strangers have been done because
5:48
you can tell the creosote level that
5:50
those had more more more modern but the
5:52
stringers right at the what was the
5:55
former gears underneath it look like
5:58
those are much older and that's what
6:00
failed so in order to get the process
6:04
going
6:05
I suggested to them that they proposed
6:09
it that this new structure
6:11
virtually the same as what we have there
6:14
now I don't think anybody wants to have
6:16
the look of the footbridge change the
6:20
the span would retain the appearance of
6:21
the existing structure through use of
6:24
timber elements and in a frame to
6:25
support steel tension rods remain
6:29
stationary without the ability to be
6:30
open now that's just a starting point if
6:34
public opinion is that they wanted to
6:36
swing again they can certainly change
6:39
the scope of the project to do that
6:40
that's TVD at this point I'm what's most
6:44
important for them is to and do some
6:48
structural analysis of the of the span
6:51
will be doing structural analysis of the
6:57
bridge determine the weight of the
6:58
existing bridge allowable design loading
7:00
and likely vertical loads on the pile
7:02
foundation the pilings and that area all
7:05
seem to be in good condition
7:07
let's get just so you know their next
7:11
step after that would be repaired design
7:14
and development they would complete a
7:16
preliminary and final design and
7:17
recommended bridge repairs and prepare
7:21
plans to prepare a suitable for public
7:22
good solicitation all plans must be
7:25
prepared to stand by a licensed
7:27
professional engineer as you know this
7:29
capacity up to a public good at some
7:31
point so they will be recommending the
7:33
design so that all the contractors will
7:36
get on have the exact same
7:37
specifications they would also be
7:41
working with code enforcement officer
7:43
and taking a lead role with all the
7:44
permitting that might be necessary
7:46
that would include the dep Army Corps of
7:49
Engineers even the US Coast Guard and
7:53
and possibly a short lanzone permit
7:56
after that they will assist with the
8:00
with the big phase they will meet with
8:02
the contractors were bidding on the
8:05
project answer any questions so that
8:07
again everyone is still bidding on the
8:08
same thing as you can see the project
8:11
timeline here is not as quick as anybody
8:14
would like it to be but this
8:16
the project's bigger than just replacing
8:18
a few boards here in there and the
8:22
regulatory review they expect to have
8:24
done in November the final design ready
8:28
to go out to bid would be in december
8:30
and they anticipated construction target
8:32
date somewhere in january-february
8:34
that's the end of the week choose for
8:36
someone to do the work so that's the the
8:43
basics of where we are at the moment
8:44
they're having some questions about the
8:47
bridge get inspected
8:49
yes the footbridge gets inspected every
8:51
year and we also budget five thousand
8:54
dollars a year for repairs this
8:56
particular scope of work is something
8:58
outside what Public Works could do so
9:01
that's that's it for that answer any
9:04
questions people might have to do they
9:07
give us a quote for this effort for the
9:10
engineering part yeah yeah they said
9:13
nobilis as they go but it could go up as
9:16
high as nineteen thousand dollars and
9:18
that would get us the bid package that
9:20
would get us everything through the big
9:22
package together okay
9:23
is there an estimate of what they think
9:25
the administration of the project would
9:29
cost under the project costs included it
9:31
says that the construction services and
9:37
i'm assuming the management is going to
9:39
be covered so do we know what that would
9:40
be beyond we won't know that until we
9:42
get bids and yeah because they won't be
9:44
they won't be managing that will be
9:46
providing maybe technical assistance but
9:48
other than that it's going to be done by
9:49
shaper contractor gets the bid so it
9:52
will be significantly more expensive
9:53
than this
9:55
the good news is that you'll hear in the
9:56
evening the audit couple weeks is that
9:59
we're in a very good position
10:01
financially or undesignated fund
10:03
balances two million dollars so the
10:07
financing part of that don't think it
10:08
was particularly the challenge
10:10
it's the process of going through the
10:12
public bidding process of selecting
10:14
winners and so forth that slows it down
10:16
so Tom in the background report it says
10:22
the swing span has remained closed for
10:26
20 years so if it's remained closed for
10:31
20 years my assumption would be that
10:33
there wouldn't be much human cry or at
10:37
least necessity to plan to reconstruct
10:41
this with the capacity of swinging
10:44
that's why I at least have them start
10:46
with a fixed structure we have to get
10:48
the ball rolling I didn't want to wait
10:49
till the next elections meeting give him
10:51
one way or the other but again that's
10:52
kind of lacking that can change that the
10:55
cost would go up obviously to put a
10:57
gearing mechanism underrated opened
10:59
again in our discussions with Barney
11:03
Baker we've pointed out that the spans
11:07
underneath the bridge have to remain as
11:09
they are you can't put pilings in there
11:11
now because everyone who has floats on
11:13
the inside wouldn't be able to get them
11:14
out for those get taken out the winner
11:16
and brought back in so we're proposing
11:18
to leave it just as it is now with the
11:20
same amount of space so that you can get
11:22
your docs and small boats in and out of
11:24
there
11:24
ok thanks
11:27
is there discussion at all about what
11:31
can be done in the meantime to open up
11:33
the the bridge for pedestrian traffic
11:35
can some type of decking be laid on you
11:39
know something to be able to short
11:40
things up and be able to take the load
11:41
so that the bridge can be opened their
11:44
number was
11:45
yeah there was a discussion that and you
11:47
could if you wanted to and have someone
11:50
build some sort of aluminum or something
11:52
to that effect span that goes to 63 feet
11:55
from one part of the footbridge that is
11:58
permanent to the other side is permanent
12:00
I don't know how much more expensive you
12:03
want this project to be given the fact
12:05
that we're going into the winter if this
12:07
was june i woulda jumped at that but it
12:10
wasn't it wasn't at the top of the
12:11
priority of the conversation since we're
12:14
going into the winter season i'm
12:16
thinking of the as as you mentioned that
12:18
the Opera House the festival of lights
12:22
it's going to be bringing hopefully
12:24
hundreds and thousands of people to
12:27
boothbay harbor the footbridge is iconic
12:30
people love to go out on there and and
12:32
view the town of the three kings use it
12:36
to walk across every Christmas to go
12:38
over the Catholic Church I'm just
12:41
wanting an aluminum certainly is a one
12:43
way to go but that seems rather
12:44
expensive we can't can we get a price on
12:46
maybe doing something with timber and
12:48
framing and you know conventional wood
12:50
materials you could keep in mind you're
12:53
going to be working in working building
12:56
one project while you're taking the
12:57
other one part so I mean they're kind of
12:59
working at cross-purposes that's good
13:02
see the general consensus that entire
13:06
section will have to be lifted out and
13:08
taken out of there so putting a
13:10
temporary structure in there would have
13:13
to be removed for the next two months
13:15
even even if it could somehow be
13:17
bolstered I i realized that things are
13:20
deteriorated and that's why we're doing
13:22
this but i agree with Mike if there was
13:26
some way we could we could support
13:29
what's there so that it was usable will
13:33
have to throw Christmas will have to
13:34
build something completely that doesn't
13:36
touch it because what's there is already
13:37
starting to to fail
13:39
yeah so we can't build on it I mean that
13:42
structure itself is not sound but you're
13:45
talking about building something I'm not
13:48
thinking about anything as it dropped
13:49
supporting it from underneath somehow
13:52
well that's where all the rod is yeah I
13:53
get that yeah we we have we have done
13:56
that to some degree but you're
13:59
supporting unstable beams on an unstable
14:02
deck beneath it you have to go back down
14:04
to the pilots pilings are in good shape
14:07
it looks to me and I don't know because
14:09
I'm not a bridge engineer but it looks
14:10
to me that over the years we know that
14:13
much of the footbridge has been replaced
14:15
but it looks like that particular
14:17
section has been there longer than the
14:21
rest of the stuff there because just the
14:23
treatment the the way the wood has aged
14:25
and its treated
14:26
it doesn't look nearly as the modern
14:29
construction on each side of it so I
14:32
mean I'm willing to you know throw that
14:35
idea out there and see what that would
14:36
cost and in the meantime I'm going to do
14:38
hopefully keep this going for inside we
14:41
know I think we showed yeah i think we
14:43
should and i think we probably need a
14:44
motion to do that but yeah i guess i
14:47
would ask you to do that
14:49
sure see if you could explore the this
14:53
construction is not slated to start
14:56
until every January behind frame so ya
14:59
tebe between that one man there is
15:01
something we could do to please use it
15:03
i'll look into it
15:05
trip thanks yeah and at least give us an
15:08
idea of order of magnitude of price
15:10
Yeah right sure so given that i move
15:15
that we have authorized Tom to authorize
15:22
Baker design consultants to go forward
15:27
with this effort to a not to exceed
15:34
$MONEY value of nineteen thousand
15:36
dollars and try that that was their
15:38
worst case scenario might not even be as
15:40
high giving some government might not
15:42
need him
15:43
yeah I'll second that motion right good
15:46
good
15:48
any more discussion does that with that
15:50
then mean that there is only a design to
15:55
be a non-moving portion of the other
15:58
bridge it's up to you i mean that's
16:01
that's what they've been charged with at
16:02
this point of if there's an outcry to do
16:04
it differently they said they can do it
16:06
differently as well so i might it can't
16:09
be for the rest of the board but I can
16:10
say that I've been approached by number
16:12
of town members that have said they
16:16
would like to explore the cost of what
16:18
it would take to retain the historic
16:21
nature of the bridge that things have
16:24
been
16:24
over the years events have been
16:26
postponed or put off because it wasn't
16:31
be able to be open i think it was three
16:33
years ago the Windjammer committee
16:35
approached the town to see about
16:37
bringing the antique boat parade through
16:39
and that was the bridge was unable to be
16:43
open at that point but i know that there
16:45
that there is a desire so I i would
16:49
support an effort at least to hear what
16:50
those costs would be like so before we
16:55
vote on this motion
16:58
I saw number pants from the public go up
17:00
so and i suspect that is why many of you
17:03
are here tonight so are mr. Englert i
17:07
see that you at your hand behind it
17:09
da roads and I understand the costs that
17:14
you're concerned live but i would remind
17:17
you that this is been going on for at
17:20
least 10 years at least as long as tom
17:22
has been the town manager we look at
17:25
this footage during that period might
17:28
and you're on the board and it was in
17:31
disrepair at the time and actually it
17:37
was decided not to do anything to create
17:40
some kind of a fund so that this type of
17:43
situation could be taken care understand
17:46
that we have plenty of money
17:48
I then would move quickly to one other
17:51
item that I don't think that you have
17:53
taken into consideration for too long
17:56
we've got about 36 property owners on
18:01
the back cold
18:03
some of them were commercial
18:05
establishments that have the borders and
18:08
coming and spend their money in the
18:10
summertime some of them have kayak some
18:13
of them at sailboats um
18:15
you have small motor boats some of them
18:17
do use although it has not been opened
18:21
for that purpose the navigable water and
18:26
that brings me into the next issue which
18:28
is the fish Powell and navigation
18:30
statute that goes back to the sixteen
18:33
hundreds and I don't believe there's any
18:35
way in the world that you can we build
18:38
that bridge and shut off the right to
18:41
fish file and navigate that's been on
18:44
the books forever so maybe you'd like to
18:47
take a look at a legal issue before you
18:49
start getting all I think a lot of
18:51
feedback from those that do go a little
18:54
more about that statute and about the
18:57
history of the fishing and following a
18:59
navigation again i don't believe you
19:02
have the right to shut off and find
19:05
taking the swing bridge out of the
19:08
fridge that's exactly what you're doing
19:10
ok thank you for that information will
19:16
be something probably useful to look
19:18
into that standards of any regulation
19:22
useful purpose there is a brand new
19:24
booklet on that topic I provided 122
19:31
like he probably could share that with
19:33
you or get your color up for to have
19:37
some copies for you it's pretty it's
19:40
pretty clear
19:41
ok thanks ok I thought I saw some other
19:45
hands in the audience is Jewish friends
19:47
are
19:48
hi Charla yeah are they remember they
19:52
opened the original ladies i will know
19:54
as part of that we don't end up swinging
19:56
open by and
19:58
the party goes all party together
20:01
created up through there won't even be a
20:03
big risk in those days they probably
20:04
take theirs today but besides that was
20:08
part of a bridge opening there on the
20:09
number of occasions in the boneyard
20:11
Northern Neck bridge and personally I
20:14
will bridge with jelly rebels fighting
20:16
experience early as a kid but it's bruce
20:19
it i don't think we have the right to
20:21
shut that off and to consider that i
20:24
think is quite foolish and short sight
20:27
so hopefully your consideration and put
20:32
back exactly what was there perhaps
20:34
better that's easy to operate and can
20:37
only open communication that any of
20:40
these Property Virgins or anybody else
20:41
want to steam up to that can block it
20:43
off and then she recited in foolish my
20:47
opinion and anybody else and i would say
20:53
that everybody here is in favor of that
20:55
bridge open
20:56
yeah the world
21:00
ok yes come out of miller and I all the
21:03
bridge shells can't they just take that
21:06
this to Spain that needs to be repaired
21:09
can't they just get that over Larry
21:11
called card and have been fix it in his
21:13
garage making no one and put it back
21:17
the ironwork is better the new one I
21:20
mean they take it apart if they take it
21:22
to put on a barge take it off replace it
21:24
and bring it back it seems doesn't seem
21:28
really complicated to me but it's big
21:30
all great but it's it's also a landmark
21:32
I think it should be preserved but it is
21:35
the plan to build just duplicated what's
21:39
there now it's not changing our even use
21:41
the existing span that the supports and
21:43
so forth so you know that is what we
21:45
want to do is make it is also iron
21:47
everything again right
21:49
yeah we can have a bit maybe not all of
21:51
it explored I mean all the work in this
21:54
underneath it have to be completely
21:55
redone as our body will see stuff I'm
22:00
it's a landmark once the landmarks or
22:02
compromise
22:03
they're gone you know so i would have to
22:05
be very much for haven't put back to
22:09
rights but this that's good feedback
22:10
because I didn't know what you really
22:12
wanted to go so it's obvious that people
22:13
wanted to swing this one
22:17
good that's great very thank you for all
22:20
your input that that's great that's
22:21
helpful
22:23
anybody else anybody else want to add
22:27
any additional comments
22:29
yes ma'am i would like to add I'm
22:31
Jeffrey yelled from the West Bay over
22:33
and I would like to add that I think it
22:36
i agree with people to live on the
22:38
eastside and with everything that's
22:40
going on with ESPO lights all the way
22:42
into town
22:43
we're trying to promote you no comments
22:46
here it would shut down a very important
22:49
part of town boothbay harbor and to see
22:52
the people over the weekend coming from
22:55
hotels to cross into town to eat dinner
22:59
to go on tour boat and had to stop and
23:04
just figure out how we're going to get
23:05
to town a lot of people elderly your
23:08
older things cannot walk around the cold
23:10
so there was some way that the bridge
23:13
could be short of temporarily just get
23:16
through this holiday season
23:19
I really feel that the towel should look
23:20
into them
23:23
ok thank you for your input I think um I
23:28
think that on the town manager already
23:31
earned her duck everybody's comments on
23:35
I and it certainly was unfortunate that
23:37
that this was discovered but i think
23:41
personally am very grateful that it
23:43
wasn't on that nothing no accidents
23:49
occurred during the summertime that it
23:51
was discovered last week and not at the
23:55
height of the season self and I think it
23:57
was unfortunately it's not what we all
24:00
want to see but it was the prudent
24:02
decision to close the the footbridge for
24:05
the time being while we figure out
24:08
what can be done so we need it is
24:12
important that no accidents occur i mean
24:16
safety is number one here
24:18
sounds good thanks Tom for moving
24:21
quickly on this
24:22
yeah you walk down this very appropriate
24:24
that's a great part of my job by the way
24:26
closing the footbridge guess we all have
24:33
hearts of our jobs that we don't like
24:35
good I'm give anything else to trip for
24:39

do we have any selectmen's reports
29:37
tonight
29:39
jdc or leaving the only thing that I
29:42
wanted to make quick note of from the
29:45
ambulance service was the we all heard
29:48
about the fire stay over the weekend
29:54
sunday night and it's a rare occurrence
29:58
that we have all four ambulances out at
30:01
one time but it does happen and sunday
30:04
night was was such an occasion so I just
30:09
wanted to recognize all those folks that
30:11
came out that night and responded to
30:14
that emergency
30:18
tragedy thanks Russ the Joint Economic
30:24
Development Committee did have a meeting
30:27
last week the focus of our meeting was a
30:32
really preparing for our retreat that
30:35
we're going to have sort of a mini
30:36
retreat to talk about sort of strategy
30:39
and longer-term goals for the JDC the
30:45
big event i think is what Tom alluded to
30:47
which was the meeting that green tree
30:50
events had with the local businesses and
30:54
members of the public that attended to
30:56
really talk about the boothbay festival
30:58
of lights and how that's going to unfold
31:02
what were the sort of the resources that
31:04
were available to businesses and what
31:06
the plans were to really have this sort
31:10
of interaction with the garden during
31:11
the Garden of glow i was unable to
31:14
attend that meeting because of the
31:16
conflict and Tommy Mike if either of you
31:21
were there did you want to just fill in
31:22
some details I assume there was a good
31:24
crowd and I've had preliminary feedback
31:26
that people felt very energized and
31:29
excited by the planning and all the
31:33
activities that are going to occur with
31:36
the tempering caution that this is a
31:40
long-term strategy that's going to roll
31:42
out sort of year after year building on
31:45
the substance or first-years activities
31:49
so that we shouldn't expect that it's
31:51
going to be in instant you know success
31:55
with the town flooded with people but
31:57
this is the first year of really
31:59
improving the interaction and try to get
32:02
people from the garden to come into the
32:04
businesses and populate the downtown eat
32:08
and shop etc stay overnight and each
32:11
year as awareness of this event grows we
32:14
expect that they'll be more and more
32:16
visitors that know that we are open for
32:18
business during this time and that
32:21
there's a lot to do in the Harper beside
32:23
just come see the garden of glow so that
32:26
would I don't know microwave they're
32:28
also either
32:30
yeah and it's gonna throw and like you
32:31
can add on to this i was very impressive
32:34
to turn out there must be at least a
32:35
hundred people there i mean it was a
32:36
great was a full full room channel seven
32:39
was there the registers era step up from
32:42
Greentree events gave a very good
32:44
overview of what they've done so far
32:46
what things they are planning going
32:48
forward as far as their marketing
32:49
efforts and things like that and maybe
32:52
might can come into that more than then
32:54
i can and i was asked just like I said
32:57
just to talk about the membership part
33:00
of it the mission of the economic
33:01
development committee and then just to
33:03
describe what the town said setup for
33:05
lighting it up with the lighting plans
33:07
were alerted to earlier but it but
33:11
roughly an hour i think and had a good
33:13
open question and answers session after
33:17
it was a lot of materials handed out for
33:19
people this shop owners put their their
33:21
windows and so forth and stickers to
33:23
advertise the event and so forth there
33:27
there was a lot of enthusiasm i stopped
33:29
counting after 80 it was well attended
33:32
and I think the things that came across
33:34
very importantly was what Tom mentioned
33:37
about some of the parking concerns that
33:40
they're going to be coming to carpool
33:43
lots at the edge of town hall at
33:45
boothbay town hall and over at
33:47
the park I thought it was delivered back
33:51
to the park and then that there's going
33:52
to be a shuttle service out of the town
33:55
hall parking lot and the whole idea is
33:57
to have people come down shop dine
34:00
enjoyed with the harbor the water the
34:02
the season and then be able to take a
34:05
shuttle up to the gardens and then come
34:08
back and maybe finish off the evening
34:09
here tom was a date on the booth Bay
34:15
Peninsula day wasn't it descends our
34:17
december seven right and that imagine
34:19
that
34:20
yeah there's a fire going out I haven't
34:21
received a person myself but we have all
34:23
the materials to hand up when people do
34:25
receivable is a fire going out to the
34:28
residence of all four towns instructed
34:30
to go to their town offices and they can
34:32
pick up a card is three different times
34:35
for on the residence the peninsula to go
34:39
see the gardens ago for free and
34:42
depending on what time you want is a
34:45
different color coupon and so forth for
34:48
that it's also a handout that describes
34:50
the bus bus routes
34:52
there's a lighting contest as well
34:53
that's that's going on with the first
34:55
prize is twenty-five hundred dollars and
34:57
I think 13 tickets two guards to go over
35:01
the garden is very generous and so in
35:07
that answer
35:07
yeah exactly notice that was one of
35:09
these take boys there seemed to be a lot
35:12
of enthusiasm and a lot of social media
35:15
that's going to be taking over there is
35:17
a website that individuals go to for
35:19
town for information and then you can
35:21
also get the the show on DRC TV as well
35:24
they talked about it so if everyone
35:27
comes down it spends their remember
35:29
December with us can be great i also
35:32
addressed them the charming topic of
35:34
that we will have additional restroom
35:36
facilities available and these these
35:39
restrooms i disobey open during the
35:40
event but we're going to bring in some
35:41
temporary ones here at the at the
35:44
location of the shuttle bus stops
35:46
because the other
35:47
to get close because they're not heated
35:49
so but we'll plan on having some
35:52
additional space
35:54
great okay happy to answer questions so
36:00
good
36:03
yep good alright good report so we'll
36:08
move on to new business now you want to
36:13
propose a yeah i'll take that as you
36:16
know Atlantic edges lease is up at the
36:20
end of this year so it's time to
36:22
renegotiate for the third and final
36:23
extension which is part of the original
36:26
rental agreement
36:28
any tips would like to extend his least
36:31
for one more year and the reason it's
36:33
one rather than five is that want to
36:37
have us and i completely agree
36:40
look into the condition of the building
36:42
that's there and over the last few years
36:46
we pumped a fair amount of money into
36:47
that Atlanta gets building new roof new
36:49
doors we just put a new floor and
36:52
because the concrete floor was cracked
36:54
and so forth and repaint it is picking
36:57
room is and done quite a bit of work on
36:59
their butt and the more you look at it
37:02
the more you realize you're probably
37:03
throwing good money after bad because
37:05
the design of that building with the
37:07
with the would collaborate and so forth
37:09
it its it's on post concrete deck comes
37:14
up to it rain water comes down splashes
37:16
on that and rots the whole bar in the
37:18
building so i think we're looking at
37:21
something more significant than just a
37:22
band-aid down there and i think by my
37:25
recommendation would be that we look
37:26
into the option of replacing that
37:29
building just as we did the harbor bait
37:32
building
37:33
Eddie is going to get me a concept of
37:37
what the space might look like for him
37:39
to work we've also talked about how with
37:43
how this would happen as far as
37:46
then arranging where his lobster tanks
37:49
and things like that go well this is all
37:50
being done
37:51
I know he's worked his talk to chuck
37:53
fuller about possibly using some of that
37:54
garage spaces a temporary location and
37:57
so he knows were very willing to work
37:59
with him work around his this business
38:01
schedule he also knows that with
38:04
everything municipal government takes
38:06
longer than you think and that this
38:08
would have to go with that town meeting
38:10
to get a vote to approve doing that so
38:12
we're talking 2017-18 at this point but
38:18
at this point what he's looking for is
38:20
to do one more calendar year and just
38:26
see where we're going with the the
38:28
renovation or replacement of that
38:30
building before he commits to the longer
38:32
term he would like to stay there but you
38:36
also like to see what we're doing with
38:37
it before you commit so I would ask the
38:40
board permission to go ahead and sign
38:43
the lease for one more year and we'll be
38:46
talking quite a bit about getting quotes
38:49
and replacing that building and so is it
38:53
in fact the calendar year Jersey where
38:55
the calendar year December yeah
39:01
I'll make the motion to approve the year
39:05
lease renewal segment ok
39:10
any discussion I understand the least
39:14
and granola is for one year and no
39:17
increasing in price and it sounds to me
39:21
like there's maybe not necessarily
39:23
substandard building but it's it's not
39:27
meeting is you know it is meeting its
39:30
goals but it's not it's not the pits not
39:33
the best does that justify leaving the
39:36
price at the same for lease has there
39:39
been increases in the past
39:41
oh yeah he gets he gets a your mobile
39:43
CPI increase you know for for this one
39:48
year I wasn't going to quibble over that
39:50
coming the fish . self-sufficient so
39:53
he's also thinking and wisely so that if
39:57
we do replace that building his lease
39:59
terms are going to change and he's going
40:00
to happen additional rent that will be
40:02
do so i looked at that as sort of a
40:06
concession going on call for them for
40:07
the next year what we figure out what
40:09
we're doing before we invest large
40:11
amount of money into that and probably
40:13
adjust your rent up I thought it was
40:16
fair to leave it alone but ok i'm
40:19
usually not talking much money even if
40:20
you do get the Consumer Price Index the
40:23
two-percent one-and-a-half percent not a
40:25
lot of money
40:28
doing that do we think we're gonna have
40:31
the plan for the redesign before march
40:36
first large first of southern accent
40:40
yeah i'm gonna try yeah well we'll need
40:44
to finish building your it
40:45
yeah I know what I'm asking me obviously
40:47
yeah there's some expediency yeah yeah
40:51
well I don't have anything else to do
40:53
sure about that
40:57
I hope that is the plan yeah alright
40:59
well i hope you understand it is also
41:01
flexible to he understands the timing of
41:03
municipal government and if it doesn't
41:04
work he always not waiting another year
41:06
yeah he's not adverse to saying right
41:09
let's extend it another year so all
41:10
right
41:11
this flexibility there are there any
41:12
safety concerns or issues with the
41:14
existing structure now when it gets
41:17
inspected regularly by MMA and the fire
41:19
department so forth but there are
41:22
significant deterioration of some of the
41:25
the joists underneath the floor that's
41:27
it on the the pilings that you can't get
41:29
too unless you tear the concrete
41:31
flooring off i mean you're talking about
41:33
if you want to do any kind of
41:34
renovations it would probably cost less
41:36
to replace the building that what to do
41:38
all these renovations and just like it
41:42
did with the other building were
41:43
replaced
41:45
ok ok
41:48
ah so all in favor of extending the
41:51
lease
41:52
alright so for and can and Kelly
41:55

41:57

told Phil but I everyone seemed to be
42:35
pretty excited about doing it
42:37
things with one of physical don't let
42:38
him know what I was ashamed because it
42:41
kept the fires going
42:42
it's fall again was rekindling that fire
42:45
anyone's going to give us an idea of
42:49
which way we go
42:50
what we do you see on the docket town
42:56
meeting March be super get some feedback
43:00
on that we have people who are
43:01
interested in private funding as well as
43:03
hopefully some town funding and that's
43:07
basically why we're here
43:08
you want to keep the ball rolling it it
43:10
looks horrible and it always has that
43:12
whole area tie that into the same
43:15
project just been rebuilt do this in the
43:19
spring and in the fall whatever it's
43:21
another year gone by and we're going to
43:23
break ground fault but no one seemed to
43:25
keep the ball rolling on that so here i
43:27
am again and like to know what you guys
43:30
feel about this still we losing suction
43:33
here or we're gonna go with it
43:35
okay thanks for reminding us about that
43:39
and I guess I'm gonna have to i actually
43:42
got there was an issue with DP or what
43:46
do I didn't get much traction got a lot
43:47
of traction with you but it didn't get a
43:49
lot of traction with anyone else so
43:50
that's my guy is going to be
43:52
contractually time
43:53
casket drops to 40 or 50 people in all
43:59
you have to do is take a walk down here
44:01
to look at it and to be given sizing I
44:06
know that this is one thing and this
44:08
kind of rolls into I just had a couple
44:10
items to preparing up which was about
44:12
our selections goals and it was one of
44:14
the things that I was hoping to focus on
44:17
my time here is to look at areas for
44:19
capital improvements and I think Bob
44:24
raises a good point do we need to look
44:25
at even a larger picture are we just
44:30
replacing something that's broken on the
44:32
footbridge do we need to get what we
44:34
want to consider upgrades and improving
44:38
the look and appearance
44:39
we're inviting these hundreds and
44:41
thousands of people to our town for the
44:45
festival of lights were working with
44:49
john economic development between
44:50
boothbay and boothbay harbor
44:52
how are we what what what is our plan
44:55
for improving the look and feel of the
44:58
town and with the footage being as
45:00
iconic and the the the parking area next
45:04
to that I know that there are some great
45:06
ideas that we come up with that can meet
45:09
the town's needs of having a place to be
45:11
able to store snow in the winter and yet
45:15
are on our visitors of being able to
45:17
approach the water the Planning Board
45:20
had a presentation at a special meeting
45:23
last week a week before by a potential
45:27
developer for the bowling alley and part
45:30
of that plan included a softening a
45:33
greening of the shore area basically
45:37
along the bowling alley parking lot and
45:40
do any type of improvements along that
45:43
buffered edge by the footbridge parking
45:45
lot would carry on that theme
45:47
and go with our ideas of walkability
45:49
accessibility turn that we've talked
45:51
about so I I i continued support Bob's
45:56
thoughts and the others about their and
45:59
now as we come forward a budget season
46:02
maybe we can add that as our selectmen's
46:05
goals and and see what areas we can work
46:08
on and try and get established
46:11
yeah I think that's a good idea i would
46:13
agree with ok we did look at a couple of
46:17
concepts we yeah yeah we did
46:20
if I remember predator is the dep that
46:23
we ran into a problem with that's what
46:25
my collection Sinai my notes from there
46:27
and did we ever get a price now we never
46:32
went to that point
46:34
could we revisit that of our next
46:38
meeting and just go back and figure out
46:40
where we were in the process with DP and
46:43
everything else I didn't get cancer
46:45
yeah yes sir i'm still here they were
46:53
talking about getting permits and so
46:56
forth getting the building permits
46:58
getting that part of it started and
47:00
there's a private fund set up that will
47:02
pay for that
47:03
laters forward dollars for the people to
47:06
look at and see see what can be done
47:09
that sort of has to happen i think
47:11
before you put bits out have to know
47:13
what you're allowed to do and private
47:17
funding is still available for that and
47:20
I don't see any reason why I can't go
47:22
forward
47:23
I don't you apply to so many people
47:26
growing but there is a permitting
47:30
process it costs a certain amount to get
47:32
started as items
47:34
right there right
47:39
well I am i well the issue is is that i
47:44
don't think it's the cost of the
47:45
permitting process that's holding it up
47:47
i think that we just need to revisit
47:49
where we were in the assessment process
47:51
revisit what it was with the EDP
47:56
conversation and you all have
47:58
articulated I think oh well founded
48:01
rekindling or get the fire lit once
48:04
again to try and get this project moving
48:06
forward so I I'll speak for myself I'm
48:09
not sure it's the four hundred dollars
48:11
say the permitting process that would be
48:14
the issue is just for us to revisit
48:16
figure out was everything in a road it
48:19
lined up so that we can move forward
48:22
with the permitting process and relook
48:25
at the design phase so I think it's
48:28
great to bring this up again we need to
48:30
do our homework to circle back and
48:33
figure out where we were in the
48:34
assessment process because i agree with
48:36
you i remember everyone was very
48:37
enthusiastic we felt like this was a
48:40
very important part of sort of the
48:43
presentation of the harbor to try and
48:45
beautify it make the rock skipping a
48:48
better-looking place with the stairs
48:50
down to have the rock skipping not have
48:53
the kids out on the you know riffraff or
48:55
whatever and if we're looking at
48:59
improvements to the footbridge it makes
49:00
sense to try and look at that area
49:03
holistically particularly if something's
49:05
going to happen in the bowling alley
49:06
that makes sort of the Perry harbor area
49:10
much more sort of user inviting and
49:12
friendly so I think it's really
49:14
opportune that you've brought this up
49:16
and give us motivation to get back
49:21
engaged in the process so thank you
49:23
thank you
49:25
ok so let young asian next meeting
49:31
yeah I will see why not well sure we can
49:34
put it on the agenda and I think people
49:36
need to remember that this would be a
49:38
capital project that would have to go
49:40
through the the normal capital budgeting
49:45
process so and then get on the town
49:52
warrants at the next town meeting from a
49:56
budget perspective because something in
49:59
the back of my mind to some of the plan
50:00
designs that we had were they were very
50:03
very costly but I could be mixing that
50:05
up with something else so i'll let Tom
50:07
go back to his smile and a kick-out
50:10
yep what we had it from a year ago so i
50:18
have two other questions
50:19
sure oh this is caught in the act of
50:22
doing something great today I was a
50:24
participant in the annual closing event
50:26
over at Dutton's doghouse with Gary one
50:32
man one business and he generated so
50:34
much goodwill and so many people showed
50:36
up from our community it it almost tears
50:41
me up to belong to a place that's
50:43
something like this can happen and it
50:45
was it was spectacular Gary worked hard
50:47
all year and it was absolutely no cost
50:49
there was a donation jar if you wanted
50:51
to
50:52
there was music there are people
50:53
laughing they're having a great time I
50:55
