    {"startTime":"4:33","said":"23 foot beam that's completely"},

    {"startTime":"4:47","said":"marine came down as you know and the"},

    {"startTime":"4:53","said":"unfortunately before columbus day"},
    {"startTime":"4:56","said":"weekend we also had the next day we"},
    {"startTime":"5:01","said":"asked for an engineering company to come"},
    {"startTime":"5:03","said":"down to take a look at it give us their"},
    {"startTime":"5:05","said":"opinions on that and i'll go over some"},
    {"startTime":"5:07","said":"of what they have provided here for that"},
    {"startTime":"5:09","said":"the same day we also had represented"},
    {"startTime":"5:12","said":"from Maine Municipal Association here"},
    {"startTime":"5:14","said":"which is our insurance carrier so"},
    {"startTime":"5:15","said":"they're aware of the issue and what what"},
    {"startTime":"5:21","said":"transpired last week was Nick up from"},
    {"startTime":"5:24","said":"Christian myself and the two"},
    {"startTime":"5:27","said":"representatives from Baker consultants"},
    {"startTime":"5:29","said":"and went out to the swing portion of the"},
    {"startTime":"5:32","said":"superstructure and the professional"},
    {"startTime":"5:37","said":"opinion given the condition of what's"},
    {"startTime":"5:38","said":"underneath the swing span is that that"},
    {"startTime":"5:41","said":"entire swing span section should be"},
    {"startTime":"5:43","said":"replaced"},
    {"startTime":"5:44","said":"you can tell in previous years that some"},
    {"startTime":"5:47","said":"of the strangers have been done because"},
    {"startTime":"5:48","said":"you can tell the creosote level that"},
    {"startTime":"5:50","said":"those had more more more modern but the"},
    {"startTime":"5:52","said":"stringers right at the what was the"},
    {"startTime":"5:55","said":"former gears underneath it look like"},
    {"startTime":"5:58","said":"those are much older and that's what"},
    {"startTime":"6:00","said":"failed so in order to get the process"},
    {"startTime":"6:04","said":"going"},
    {"startTime":"6:05","said":"I suggested to them that they proposed"},
    {"startTime":"6:09","said":"it that this new structure"},
    {"startTime":"6:11","said":"virtually the same as what we have there"},
    {"startTime":"6:14","said":"now I don't think anybody wants to have"},
    {"startTime":"6:16","said":"the look of the footbridge change the"},
    {"startTime":"6:20","said":"the span would retain the appearance of"},
    {"startTime":"6:21","said":"the existing structure through use of"},
    {"startTime":"6:24","said":"timber elements and in a frame to"},
    {"startTime":"6:25","said":"support steel tension rods remain"},
    {"startTime":"6:29","said":"stationary without the ability to be"},
    {"startTime":"6:30","said":"open now that's just a starting point if"},
    {"startTime":"6:34","said":"public opinion is that they wanted to"},
    {"startTime":"6:36","said":"swing again they can certainly change"},
    {"startTime":"6:39","said":"the scope of the project to do that"},
    {"startTime":"6:40","said":"that's TVD at this point I'm what's most"},
    {"startTime":"6:44","said":"important for them is to and do some"},
    {"startTime":"6:48","said":"structural analysis of the of the span"},
    {"startTime":"6:51","said":"will be doing structural analysis of the"},
    {"startTime":"6:57","said":"bridge determine the weight of the"},
    {"startTime":"6:58","said":"existing bridge allowable design loading"},
    {"startTime":"7:00","said":"and likely vertical loads on the pile"},
    {"startTime":"7:02","said":"foundation the pilings and that area all"},
    {"startTime":"7:05","said":"seem to be in good condition"},
    {"startTime":"7:07","said":"let's get just so you know their next"},
    {"startTime":"7:11","said":"step after that would be repaired design"},
    {"startTime":"7:14","said":"and development they would complete a"},
    {"startTime":"7:16","said":"preliminary and final design and"},
    {"startTime":"7:17","said":"recommended bridge repairs and prepare"},
    {"startTime":"7:21","said":"plans to prepare a suitable for public"},
    {"startTime":"7:22","said":"good solicitation all plans must be"},
    {"startTime":"7:25","said":"prepared to stand by a licensed"},
    {"startTime":"7:27","said":"professional engineer as you know this"},
    {"startTime":"7:29","said":"capacity up to a public good at some"},
    {"startTime":"7:31","said":"point so they will be recommending the"},
    {"startTime":"7:33","said":"design so that all the contractors will"},
    {"startTime":"7:36","said":"get on have the exact same"},
    {"startTime":"7:37","said":"specifications they would also be"},
    {"startTime":"7:41","said":"working with code enforcement officer"},
    {"startTime":"7:43","said":"and taking a lead role with all the"},
    {"startTime":"7:44","said":"permitting that might be necessary"},
    {"startTime":"7:46","said":"that would include the dep Army Corps of"},
    {"startTime":"7:49","said":"Engineers even the US Coast Guard and"},
    {"startTime":"7:53","said":"and possibly a short lanzone permit"},
    {"startTime":"7:56","said":"after that they will assist with the"},
    {"startTime":"8:00","said":"with the big phase they will meet with"},
    {"startTime":"8:02","said":"the contractors were bidding on the"},
    {"startTime":"8:05","said":"project answer any questions so that"},
    {"startTime":"8:07","said":"again everyone is still bidding on the"},
    {"startTime":"8:08","said":"same thing as you can see the project"},
    {"startTime":"8:11","said":"timeline here is not as quick as anybody"},
    {"startTime":"8:14","said":"would like it to be but this"},
    {"startTime":"8:16","said":"the project's bigger than just replacing"},
    {"startTime":"8:18","said":"a few boards here in there and the"},
    {"startTime":"8:22","said":"regulatory review they expect to have"},
    {"startTime":"8:24","said":"done in November the final design ready"},
    {"startTime":"8:28","said":"to go out to bid would be in december"},
    {"startTime":"8:30","said":"and they anticipated construction target"},
    {"startTime":"8:32","said":"date somewhere in january-february"},
    {"startTime":"8:34","said":"that's the end of the week choose for"},
    {"startTime":"8:36","said":"someone to do the work so that's the the"},
    {"startTime":"8:43","said":"basics of where we are at the moment"},
    {"startTime":"8:44","said":"they're having some questions about the"},
    {"startTime":"8:47","said":"bridge get inspected"},
    {"startTime":"8:49","said":"yes the footbridge gets inspected every"},
    {"startTime":"8:51","said":"year and we also budget five thousand"},
    {"startTime":"8:54","said":"dollars a year for repairs this"},
    {"startTime":"8:56","said":"particular scope of work is something"},
    {"startTime":"8:58","said":"outside what Public Works could do so"},
    {"startTime":"9:01","said":"that's that's it for that answer any"},
    {"startTime":"9:04","said":"questions people might have to do they"},
    {"startTime":"9:07","said":"give us a quote for this effort for the"},
    {"startTime":"9:10","said":"engineering part yeah yeah they said"},
    {"startTime":"9:13","said":"nobilis as they go but it could go up as"},
    {"startTime":"9:16","said":"high as nineteen thousand dollars and"},
    {"startTime":"9:18","said":"that would get us the bid package that"},
    {"startTime":"9:20","said":"would get us everything through the big"},
    {"startTime":"9:22","said":"package together okay"},
    {"startTime":"9:23","said":"is there an estimate of what they think"},
    {"startTime":"9:25","said":"the administration of the project would"},
    {"startTime":"9:29","said":"cost under the project costs included it"},
    {"startTime":"9:31","said":"says that the construction services and"},
    {"startTime":"9:37","said":"i'm assuming the management is going to"},
    {"startTime":"9:39","said":"be covered so do we know what that would"},
    {"startTime":"9:40","said":"be beyond we won't know that until we"},
    {"startTime":"9:42","said":"get bids and yeah because they won't be"},
    {"startTime":"9:44","said":"they won't be managing that will be"},
    {"startTime":"9:46","said":"providing maybe technical assistance but"},
    {"startTime":"9:48","said":"other than that it's going to be done by"},
    {"startTime":"9:49","said":"shaper contractor gets the bid so it"},
    {"startTime":"9:52","said":"will be significantly more expensive"},
    {"startTime":"9:53","said":"than this"},
    {"startTime":"9:55","said":"the good news is that you'll hear in the"},
    {"startTime":"9:56","said":"evening the audit couple weeks is that"},
    {"startTime":"9:59","said":"we're in a very good position"},
    {"startTime":"10:01","said":"financially or undesignated fund"},
    {"startTime":"10:03","said":"balances two million dollars so the"},
    {"startTime":"10:07","said":"financing part of that don't think it"},
    {"startTime":"10:08","said":"was particularly the challenge"},
    {"startTime":"10:10","said":"it's the process of going through the"},
    {"startTime":"10:12","said":"public bidding process of selecting"},
    {"startTime":"10:14","said":"winners and so forth that slows it down"},
    {"startTime":"10:16","said":"so Tom in the background report it says"},
    {"startTime":"10:22","said":"the swing span has remained closed for"},
    {"startTime":"10:26","said":"20 years so if it's remained closed for"},
    {"startTime":"10:31","said":"20 years my assumption would be that"},
    {"startTime":"10:33","said":"there wouldn't be much human cry or at"},
    {"startTime":"10:37","said":"least necessity to plan to reconstruct"},
    {"startTime":"10:41","said":"this with the capacity of swinging"},
    {"startTime":"10:44","said":"that's why I at least have them start"},
    {"startTime":"10:46","said":"with a fixed structure we have to get"},
    {"startTime":"10:48","said":"the ball rolling I didn't want to wait"},
    {"startTime":"10:49","said":"till the next elections meeting give him"},
    {"startTime":"10:51","said":"one way or the other but again that's"},
    {"startTime":"10:52","said":"kind of lacking that can change that the"},
    {"startTime":"10:55","said":"cost would go up obviously to put a"},
    {"startTime":"10:57","said":"gearing mechanism underrated opened"},
    {"startTime":"10:59","said":"again in our discussions with Barney"},
    {"startTime":"11:03","said":"Baker we've pointed out that the spans"},
    {"startTime":"11:07","said":"underneath the bridge have to remain as"},
    {"startTime":"11:09","said":"they are you can't put pilings in there"},
    {"startTime":"11:11","said":"now because everyone who has floats on"},
    {"startTime":"11:13","said":"the inside wouldn't be able to get them"},
    {"startTime":"11:14","said":"out for those get taken out the winner"},
    {"startTime":"11:16","said":"and brought back in so we're proposing"},
    {"startTime":"11:18","said":"to leave it just as it is now with the"},
    {"startTime":"11:20","said":"same amount of space so that you can get"},
    {"startTime":"11:22","said":"your docs and small boats in and out of"},
    {"startTime":"11:24","said":"there"},
    {"startTime":"11:24","said":"ok thanks"},
    {"startTime":"11:27","said":"is there discussion at all about what"},
    {"startTime":"11:31","said":"can be done in the meantime to open up"},
    {"startTime":"11:33","said":"the the bridge for pedestrian traffic"},
    {"startTime":"11:35","said":"can some type of decking be laid on you"},
    {"startTime":"11:39","said":"know something to be able to short"},
    {"startTime":"11:40","said":"things up and be able to take the load"},
    {"startTime":"11:41","said":"so that the bridge can be opened their"},
    {"startTime":"11:44","said":"number was"},
    {"startTime":"11:45","said":"yeah there was a discussion that and you"},
    {"startTime":"11:47","said":"could if you wanted to and have someone"},
    {"startTime":"11:50","said":"build some sort of aluminum or something"},
    {"startTime":"11:52","said":"to that effect span that goes to 63 feet"},
    {"startTime":"11:55","said":"from one part of the footbridge that is"},
    {"startTime":"11:58","said":"permanent to the other side is permanent"},
    {"startTime":"12:00","said":"I don't know how much more expensive you"},
    {"startTime":"12:03","said":"want this project to be given the fact"},
    {"startTime":"12:05","said":"that we're going into the winter if this"},
    {"startTime":"12:07","said":"was june i woulda jumped at that but it"},
    {"startTime":"12:10","said":"wasn't it wasn't at the top of the"},
    {"startTime":"12:11","said":"priority of the conversation since we're"},
    {"startTime":"12:14","said":"going into the winter season i'm"},
    {"startTime":"12:16","said":"thinking of the as as you mentioned that"},
    {"startTime":"12:18","said":"the Opera House the festival of lights"},
    {"startTime":"12:22","said":"it's going to be bringing hopefully"},
    {"startTime":"12:24","said":"hundreds and thousands of people to"},
    {"startTime":"12:27","said":"boothbay harbor the footbridge is iconic"},
    {"startTime":"12:30","said":"people love to go out on there and and"},
    {"startTime":"12:32","said":"view the town of the three kings use it"},
    {"startTime":"12:36","said":"to walk across every Christmas to go"},
    {"startTime":"12:38","said":"over the Catholic Church I'm just"},
    {"startTime":"12:41","said":"wanting an aluminum certainly is a one"},
    {"startTime":"12:43","said":"way to go but that seems rather"},
    {"startTime":"12:44","said":"expensive we can't can we get a price on"},
    {"startTime":"12:46","said":"maybe doing something with timber and"},
    {"startTime":"12:48","said":"framing and you know conventional wood"},
    {"startTime":"12:50","said":"materials you could keep in mind you're"},
    {"startTime":"12:53","said":"going to be working in working building"},
    {"startTime":"12:56","said":"one project while you're taking the"},
    {"startTime":"12:57","said":"other one part so I mean they're kind of"},
    {"startTime":"12:59","said":"working at cross-purposes that's good"},
    {"startTime":"13:02","said":"see the general consensus that entire"},
    {"startTime":"13:06","said":"section will have to be lifted out and"},
    {"startTime":"13:08","said":"taken out of there so putting a"},
    {"startTime":"13:10","said":"temporary structure in there would have"},
    {"startTime":"13:13","said":"to be removed for the next two months"},
    {"startTime":"13:15","said":"even even if it could somehow be"},
    {"startTime":"13:17","said":"bolstered I i realized that things are"},
    {"startTime":"13:20","said":"deteriorated and that's why we're doing"},
    {"startTime":"13:22","said":"this but i agree with Mike if there was"},
    {"startTime":"13:26","said":"some way we could we could support"},
    {"startTime":"13:29","said":"what's there so that it was usable will"},
    {"startTime":"13:33","said":"have to throw Christmas will have to"},
    {"startTime":"13:34","said":"build something completely that doesn't"},
    {"startTime":"13:36","said":"touch it because what's there is already"},
    {"startTime":"13:37","said":"starting to to fail"},
    {"startTime":"13:39","said":"yeah so we can't build on it I mean that"},
    {"startTime":"13:42","said":"structure itself is not sound but you're"},
    {"startTime":"13:45","said":"talking about building something I'm not"},
    {"startTime":"13:48","said":"thinking about anything as it dropped"},
    {"startTime":"13:49","said":"supporting it from underneath somehow"},
    {"startTime":"13:52","said":"well that's where all the rod is yeah I"},
    {"startTime":"13:53","said":"get that yeah we we have we have done"},
    {"startTime":"13:56","said":"that to some degree but you're"},
    {"startTime":"13:59","said":"supporting unstable beams on an unstable"},
    {"startTime":"14:02","said":"deck beneath it you have to go back down"},
    {"startTime":"14:04","said":"to the pilots pilings are in good shape"},
    {"startTime":"14:07","said":"it looks to me and I don't know because"},
    {"startTime":"14:09","said":"I'm not a bridge engineer but it looks"},
    {"startTime":"14:10","said":"to me that over the years we know that"},
    {"startTime":"14:13","said":"much of the footbridge has been replaced"},
    {"startTime":"14:15","said":"but it looks like that particular"},
    {"startTime":"14:17","said":"section has been there longer than the"},
    {"startTime":"14:21","said":"rest of the stuff there because just the"},

    {"startTime":"36:23","said":"extension which is part of the original"},
    {"startTime":"36:26","said":"rental agreement"},

    {"startTime":"36:33","said":"one rather than five is that want to"},
    {"startTime":"36:37","said":"have us and i completely agree"},
    {"startTime":"36:40","said":"look into the condition of the building"},
    {"startTime":"36:42","said":"that's there and over the last few years"},
    {"startTime":"36:46","said":"we pumped a fair amount of money into"},
    {"startTime":"36:47","said":"that Atlanta gets building new roof new"},
    {"startTime":"36:49","said":"doors we just put a new floor and"},
    {"startTime":"36:52","said":"because the concrete floor was cracked"},
    {"startTime":"36:54","said":"and so forth and repaint it is picking"},
    {"startTime":"36:57","said":"room is and done quite a bit of work on"},
    {"startTime":"36:59","said":"their butt and the more you look at it"},
    {"startTime":"37:02","said":"the more you realize you're probably"},
    {"startTime":"37:03","said":"throwing good money after bad because"},
    {"startTime":"37:05","said":"the design of that building with the"},

    {"startTime":"37:16","said":"on that and rots the whole bar in the"},
    {"startTime":"37:18","said":"building so i think we're looking at"},
    {"startTime":"37:21","said":"something more significant than just a"},
    {"startTime":"37:22","said":"band-aid down there and i think by my"},
    {"startTime":"37:25","said":"recommendation would be that we look"},
    {"startTime":"37:26","said":"into the option of replacing that"},
    {"startTime":"37:29","said":"building just as we did the harbor bait"},
    {"startTime":"37:32","said":"building"},
    {"startTime":"37:33","said":"Eddie is going to get me a concept of"},
    {"startTime":"37:37","said":"what the space might look like for him"},
    {"startTime":"37:39","said":"to work we've also talked about how with"},
    {"startTime":"37:43","said":"how this would happen as far as"},
    {"startTime":"37:46","said":"then arranging where his lobster tanks"},
    {"startTime":"37:49","said":"and things like that go well this is all"},
    {"startTime":"37:50","said":"being done"},
    {"startTime":"37:51","said":"I know he's worked his talk to chuck"},
    {"startTime":"37:53","said":"fuller about possibly using some of that"},
    {"startTime":"37:54","said":"garage spaces a temporary location and"},
    {"startTime":"37:57","said":"so he knows were very willing to work"},
    {"startTime":"37:59","said":"with him work around his this business"},
    {"startTime":"38:01","said":"schedule he also knows that with"},
    {"startTime":"38:04","said":"everything municipal government takes"},
    {"startTime":"38:06","said":"longer than you think and that this"},
    {"startTime":"38:08","said":"would have to go with that town meeting"},
    {"startTime":"38:10","said":"to get a vote to approve doing that so"},
    {"startTime":"38:12","said":"we're talking 2017-18 at this point but"},
    {"startTime":"38:18","said":"at this point what he's looking for is"},
    {"startTime":"38:20","said":"to do one more calendar year and just"},
    {"startTime":"38:26","said":"see where we're going with the the"},
    {"startTime":"38:28","said":"renovation or replacement of that"},
    {"startTime":"38:30","said":"building before he commits to the longer"},
    {"startTime":"38:32","said":"term he would like to stay there but you"},
    {"startTime":"38:36","said":"also like to see what we're doing with"},
    {"startTime":"38:37","said":"it before you commit so I would ask the"},
    {"startTime":"38:40","said":"board permission to go ahead and sign"},
    {"startTime":"38:43","said":"the lease for one more year and we'll be"},
    {"startTime":"38:46","said":"talking quite a bit about getting quotes"},
    {"startTime":"38:49","said":"and replacing that building and so is it"},
    {"startTime":"38:53","said":"in fact the calendar year Jersey where"},
    {"startTime":"38:55","said":"the calendar year December yeah"},
    {"startTime":"39:01","said":"I'll make the motion to approve the year"},
    {"startTime":"39:05","said":"lease renewal segment ok"},
    {"startTime":"39:10","said":"any discussion I understand the least"},
    {"startTime":"39:14","said":"and granola is for one year and no"},
    {"startTime":"39:17","said":"increasing in price and it sounds to me"},
    {"startTime":"39:21","said":"like there's maybe not necessarily"},
    {"startTime":"39:23","said":"substandard building but it's it's not"},
    {"startTime":"39:27","said":"meeting is you know it is meeting its"},
    {"startTime":"39:30","said":"goals but it's not it's not the pits not"},
    {"startTime":"39:33","said":"the best does that justify leaving the"},
    {"startTime":"39:36","said":"price at the same for lease has there"},
    {"startTime":"39:39","said":"been increases in the past"},
    {"startTime":"39:41","said":"oh yeah he gets he gets a your mobile"},
    {"startTime":"39:43","said":"CPI increase you know for for this one"},
    {"startTime":"39:48","said":"year I wasn't going to quibble over that"},
    {"startTime":"39:50","said":"coming the fish . self-sufficient so"},
    {"startTime":"39:53","said":"he's also thinking and wisely so that if"},
    {"startTime":"39:57","said":"we do replace that building his lease"},
    {"startTime":"39:59","said":"terms are going to change and he's going"},
    {"startTime":"40:00","said":"to happen additional rent that will be"},
    {"startTime":"40:02","said":"do so i looked at that as sort of a"},
    {"startTime":"40:06","said":"concession going on call for them for"},
    {"startTime":"40:07","said":"the next year what we figure out what"},
    {"startTime":"40:09","said":"we're doing before we invest large"},
    {"startTime":"40:11","said":"amount of money into that and probably"},
    {"startTime":"40:13","said":"adjust your rent up I thought it was"},
    {"startTime":"40:16","said":"fair to leave it alone but ok i'm"},
    {"startTime":"40:19","said":"usually not talking much money even if"},
