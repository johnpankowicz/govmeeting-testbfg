17            Oh loving creator God, we come before
18 you this morning asking for your presence to be
19 upon your servants here who serve this great City

22 you as our God and ultimately to truly embody that
23 radical love in sharing it with all of your
24 creation, especially with our fellow brothers and

3 joining Councilman Jones we have Councilwoman
4 Blondell Reynolds Brown, Councilman Green,
5 Councilwoman Gym and Councilman Henon, Councilman
6 Taubenberger and Councilwoman Quinones Sanchez.
7            COUNCILMAN JONES:  So you can learn a
8 lot about your colleagues when they're exercising
9 their alter egos on the runway.  Car Dee "G" back
10 here who won.  All of them who participated,
11 motorcycles and -- you learn a lot about your
12 colleagues when you do these kinds of charitable
13 events.  And I wanted to thank all of them who
14 participated in Who Wore It Best on the runway and
15 those who came who did not participate on the
16 runway but contributed with their treasury such as
17 President Clarke, such as Councilwoman Blackwell
18 who is an champion for homeless people and also
19 Councilman Domb who is a kinder, gentler
20 capitalist.
21            So I want you to know, ladies and
22 gentlemen, it is not about who wore it best.  It is
23 about who needs it the most.  The day before we did
24 our affair, Councilman Johnson did a workshop and
25 hearing on gun violence prevention.  At that we

1 took a deeper dive into some of the causes of gun
2 violence and at its core is poverty.  At its core
3 are people who do not have jobs.  So the day of the
4 fashion show afterwards and with all the hoopla,
5 the next morning me and Captain Jack Jones, who is
6 my dog, do our constitutional walk in the morning
7 and I was reminded why it's not about who wore it
8 best, but who needs it most.  I ran into a young
9 man at 53rd and Ukling.  He was posted up.  And for
10 those of you who don't know urban vernacular that
11 means he's standing on the corner with his
12 colleagues.  He was there and he said Congressman
13 Jones.  I said no, no, no, no, no.  Councilman.
14 And so he pulled himself away from his colleagues,
15 pulled me to the side and his head was on a swivel,
16 which means he's constantly in alert of any danger,
17 police or competitors that he has.  You can always
18 tell one of those boys like Councilman Johnson when
19 their head is on a swivel.  So he says to me he
20 does not like his life-style, but he felt trapped.
21 That he worked a minimum wage job for long hours,
22 had two children and at the end of the paycheck he
23 had just enough maybe to buy clothes and food and
24 felt as a man head of his household less than.  I
25 looked him up and down.  You know, my head on a

1 swivel because I'm at 7:15 in the morning hanging
2 out with these guys noticed that he was poorly
3 dressed, missing a tooth, pants hanging down.  And
4 it wasn't that he was dressed down, because so was
5 I.  It was that he didn't know.  He was unaware of
6 his dress and how in an interview that it's totally
7 unacceptable.  So that's why I support Menzfit,
8 because if you don't know what you don't know you
9 can't do better.  If you don't know not to dress
10 for the job you have but to dress for the job you
11 want, you'll never get there.  So Rhonda Willingham
12 has done this for 10 years straight.  She deserves
13 our support, those young men, those 1200 or so that
14 she has saved deserve our support and it's not
15 about who wore it best.  It is about who needs it
16 most.  So therefore, recognizing, honoring Rhonda
17 Willingham, president and founder of Menzfit for
18 aiding in the employment of thousands of men across
19 the City of Philadelphia, hosting the annual City
20 Council Who Wore It Best Fashion Show whereas

5 different.
6            COUNCILMAN JONES:  It's not a popular
7 vote.
8            COUNCILMAN GREEN:  Whereas the
9 organization originated in Washington D.C. in 2001.
10 In June 2007 Menzfit opened a location in our City
11 of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Effectiveness.  The
12 Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency
13 noticed Menzfit advocacy endeavors and funded their

15            COUNCILWOMAN QUINONES SANCHEZ:  Whereas
16 Menzfit was founded by Rhonda Willingham, a
17 Philadelphia native.  Before starting the
18 organization Willingham worked at the Department of
19 Labor with the Clinton/Gore administration.
20 Serving as an appointee, Willingham had a focus on
21 public affairs and community outreach.  She is a
22 recipient of Philadelphia's own WDAS FM Radio's

1 Menzfit has helped more than 6100 men compete for
2 jobs which have created almost 54 million dollars
3 in taxable income.  The organization is not only a
4 nonprofit but a movement to support
5 underrepresented men living in low income inner
6 cities and helping them realize and exercise their
7 greater personal liberty and --
8            COUNCILMAN DOMB:  Whereas Menzfit
9 offers workshop series with various focuses such as
10 business etiquette and communications, diversity
11 awareness and tips on how to get through an
12 interview with ease.  Their wide range of services
13 allows clients to excel in the professional world

2 feature styles from the women of Philadelphia City
3 Council and to the 2017 winner, Councilwoman Gym.
4            COUNCILWOMAN GYM:  Whereas job hunting
5 is extremely challenging for most people, however,
6 it is more demanding when a job applicant lacks
7 confidence or is unable to present what is
8 considered an acceptable business image for
9 employment.  Menzfit had proven to be the leading
10 Philadelphia organization of its kind by taking an
11 active and innovative role in assisting the
12 underserved population, especially in this
13 increasingly competitive job market.  Now therefore
14 be it.
15            COUNCILMAN HENON:  Resolved by the City
16 Council of the City of Philadelphia that hereby
17 recognizes and honors Rhonda Willingham, president
18 and founder of Menzfit, for aiding in the
19 employment of thousands of men across this City and
20 for hosting the annual Philadelphia City Council
21 Who Wore It Best Fashion Show, which I did not win.
22 Further be resolved that a copy of this resolution
23 be presented to Rhonda Willingham and Menzfit as
24 further evidence of the sincere admiration and

4 exciting.  As many times as I have come to City

7 something that is very, very dear to my heart, is
8 actually my ministry which is Menzfit.  And I'm so
9 thankful and thrilled and grateful.  And I know I

11 the board of directors for Menzfit when I say thank
12 you not only to the City Council members here that
13 participated this year and last year.  Also, I want
14 to thank Council President Darrell Clarke.  I want
15 to thank the mayor.  He also came to our event and
16 is also a supporter of ours, so I wanted to make
17 sure that I recognized everyone.  Kenyatta Johnson
18 has been just a wonderful advocate for Menzfit and
19 I'm looking forward to working with those council
20 members that I have not built an intimate
21 relationship with but I'm looking forward to doing
22 that as we move forward into 2018.  We have got a

1 that we have helped.  The guys that we work with
2 come from homeless shelters, they come from job
3 training programs, they come from Welfare to work
4 programs, some of them are veterans.  But a large
5 majority of our clients are returning citizens and
6 that's a population that most people typically
7 don't work with and it's been difficult for them to
8 get a second chance.
9            We talk about a second chance, but in
10 all actuality it's very hard for them to get
11 employment.  So one of the focuses of our program
12 for next year is that we will be focusing heavily
13 on the returning citizens.  So we're looking at
14 doing some things within the Department of
15 Corrections where we will actually be going into
16 some of the state correctional facilities and
17 starting our workshops 60 to 90 days before
18 gentlemen are released so that we can give them --
19 so we really can give them a hand up and not a hand
20 down as they prepare to leave prison.  So we're
21 excited about that.  And I'm just thrilled to be
22 here.  I'm a little girl from West Philly, born and
23 raised.  So when I started Menzfit back in
24 Washington one of the first cities on our expansion

1 of Point Breeze South Philadelphia to improve the
2 quality of life for the neighbors of which I grew
3 up with.  And I had an opportunity one day while I
4 was doing some volunteering political work, saw a
5 young man who had slick hair and a cowboy hat on
6 and some cowboy boots and saw him speaking truth to
7 power about the issue of police brutality.  This is
8 a gentleman who advocated for criminal justice
9 reform before it was the progressive thing to do.
10 This was a gentleman who advocated around the issue
11 of youth gun violence before it became a slogan.
12 And so today I am truly honored and privileged to
13 recognize in honoring the life of Jerry Whyatt
14 Mondesire and the founding of the Philadelphia
15 Sunday Sun for its 25th anniversary.  He was a
16 social activist, a civil rights activist and always
17 advocated for all things regarding social justice.
18 And so if you knew Mr. Mondesire, if you was his
19 friend -- you definitely didn't want to be on the
20 other side and being one of his enemies.  And so I
21 had the good pleasure of being one of his friends
22 and having a chance to learn some of his wise
23 counsel during my run for City Council and he
24 invited me up to the radio station a couple times
25 and would give me some insight around why it was so

2 there's a voice for those who I was going to be
3 representing when I arrived in City Council, those
4 needed a voice in the second councilmanic district.
5            So the resolution reads honoring and
6 recognizing the Philadelphia Sunday Sun and its
7 founder, Jerry Whyatt Mondesire, on the occasion of
8 the Sun's 25th anniversary.
9            COUNCILWOMAN PARKER:  And whereas the
10 Philadelphia Sunday Sun is a weekly newspaper
11 dedicated covering local and national stories that
12 impact the African American community in
13 Philadelphia.  Since its founding in 1992, the Sun
14 has grown into a nationally respected news outlet
15 while staying true to its mission of connecting
16 Philadelphia's African American community and --
17            COUNCILWOMAN BASS:  Whereas, the Sun
18 was the brainchild of J. Whyatt Mondesire who owned
19 and played an active role in the paper's
20 publication until his death until 2015.  Trained as
21 a journalist at the City College of New York, Mr.
22 Mondesire joined in the historic 1969 campus
23 takeover that sought successfully to increase
24 diversity in the college's enrollment.  After

1 journalism career with the Baltimore Sun with the
2 quality of his work garnering increasing national
3 attention and earning the young journalist a
4 position within the Philadelphia Inquirer.  After
5 his arrival in Philadelphia, Mondesire became a
6 leading voice for diversity within the City's news
7 rooms helping to cofound the Philadelphia
8 Association of Black Journalists in 1973 and.
9            COUNCILWOMAN GYM:  Just wanted a point
10 of privilege to say to his beautiful wife and son,
11 as an Asian American woman in Philadelphia, Jerry
12 Mondesire was a mentor, a friend, a fellow warrior
13 who exhorted and embraced so many diverse people
14 into the civil rights movement and into building a
15 broader message.
16            Whereas after several years covering
17 local politics and rising to the rank of assistant
18 editor on the Inquirer's city desk, Mr. Mondesire
19 accepted a position with Congressman William H.
20 Gray, III, eventually serving as the Congressman's
21 chief of staff.  Mr. Mondesire became involved with
22 a variety of political and social causes.  Notably
23 working to craft the ball that levied sanctions
24 against South Africa's apartheid regime.  And --

1 people up here, I remember my good friend Jerry and
2 his 7:30 a.m. calls often when I was actually
3 calling him back when I was taking my son to
4 school.  A few years ago I had the opportunity to
5 purchase one of his hats during a Philadelphia
6 Association Black Journalist auction, scholarship
7 auction.  So I keep his hat in my office as a
8 reminder of his 7:30 calls.
9            After Congressman Gray's retirement in
10 1991, J. Whyatt Mondesire began again to channel
11 his passion for community activism through his work
12 in journalism.  In 1992 Mondesire founded the
13 Philadelphia Sunday Sun as an outlet for news and
14 opinions that impacted the City's African American
15 community and --
16            COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL:  Whereas, as
17 the City of Philadelphia joins the Sun in
18 celebrating its 25 anniversary, the paper continues

9 off by just saying we're honoring today Bud Newman,
10 who really has done an amazing job as president of
11 the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia.  And
12 when I thought about Bud, I looked up a quote that
13 I had remembered from Winston Churchill that he
14 exemplifies and that is, we make a living by what
15 we get, but we make a life by what we give.  And
16 what you're going to hear today from all of my
17 colleagues is how much Bud, Judy, his children,
18 grandchildren and great grandchildren have given,
19 including a fact that he probably won't tell you
20 and that is as a past president of the Jewish
21 Federation, him and his family have made the
22 largest endowment, eight-figure gift, to the
23 Federation to help others in Philadelphia.  Pretty

1            COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN:  Thank
2 you, Mr. President.  While today I speak as someone
3 who has always feared of learning how to become a
4 bike rider, I have always fully respected the
5 physical fitness benefits it brings, and in 2014
6 approached this as a public policy matter because I
7 embraced the environmental benefits as well.  The
8 record should reflect that interest on this Council
9 started in June 2014 where I introduced a bill
10 authorizing our City to plan and operate a bicycle
11 sharing program.  Since then we have passed
12 collectively over seven pieces of legislation on or
13 about bikes, bike sharing and today given several
14 recent incidents in the news and having listened
15 carefully to Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell learned
16 what's happening in her district around bikes, it's
17 time for us to reexamine with concerned
18 stakeholders how we can learn to coexist and reduce
19 the number of those that are being harmed by bikes.
20 So I look forward to, I'm sure, robust discussion
21 between bike coalitions, interested communities,
22 including churches who are trying to figure out how
23 we can coexist with the good news around bikes and
24 bike sharing.  And so with that, Mr. President, I
25 thank you.

5            In 2001, the General Assembly took over
6 the City's on-street parking functions by taking
7 over the Parking Authority.  Simply they changed
8 the appointment of the Parking Authority board from
9 being that done by the Mayor to that done by the
10 Governor.  The reason that they used in court as to
11 why they had the authority to take over a
12 municipality's parking function, on-street parking
13 function which is unconstitutional according to
14 Article three, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania State
15 Constitution was the claim that they were held
16 responsible for funding the School District of
17 Philadelphia and, therefore, they had to fund the
18 school through the Parking Authority.  And so Act
19 22 required that the Parking Authority contribute
20 45 million dollars per year to the School District
21 of Philadelphia, which if that had been done would
22 have provided over the last 16 years 720 million
23 dollars to the Philadelphia School District.  It
24 has not.  After enacting Act 22, the general
25 assembly provided additional duties and

1 responsibility to the Parking Authority within the
2 City of Philadelphia and those funds go to a
3 separate account, non-city accounts.  We actually
4 don't know how much money that is.
5            In 2004 when the cooperation agreement
6 which the city and PPA entered was about to expire,
7 the general assembly passed Act 9, which extended
8 the agreement by 10 years, taking it to 2004 -- or
9 taking it from 2004 to 2014.  But in July 2012, the
10 general assembly passed the July 2012 statute not
11 extending the agreement because the agreement was
12 going to expire in 2014, but simply enacted
13 legislation that the City's on-street parking would
14 be administered and enforced by the Philadelphia
15 Parking Authority.  That is unconstitutional.  And
16 so since 2004 and into the future, the Philadelphia
17 Parking Authority exists under the legal claim that
18 it funds our School District.  In June of 2018, the
19 SRC will be dissolved.  The City will be
20 responsible for funding the school entirely with a
21 shortage of state funds.  With that, I would ask
22 that the Governor, the legislature and our Mayor
23 act to return the administration, the control and
24 the funding of the Philadelphia Parking Authority
25 back to the City of Philadelphia.  I will note that

1 here.  I believe that the Americans are facing a
2 tax reform hoax.  A functioning Congress would go
3 after the missing and unaccounted for stolen
4 trillions of money which the Federal Reserve Bank
5 has supported, not work to give the almighty one
6 percent and the great U.S. super transnational
7 corporations a tax break in the hope of job
8 creation.  The great U.S. corporations are now
9 paying an effective two-and-a-half to
10 three-and-a-half percent tax rate.  Job creation
11 under this criteria should have happened decades
12 ago.  Congress appears to be still dedicated to the
13 Wall Street system that drives a hundred million
14 Americans into poverty.  Poverty is the actual
15 national security crisis.  Our U.S. money system
16 has been subverted and all but privatized.  The Fed
17 is still serving the banker speculators.
18            The U.S. Treasury and the Fed must
19 retrieve the unaccounted for and stolen trillions
20 with the goal of leaving the monetary financial
21 system stabilizing United States and funding the
22 redevelopment of North America.  Congress threatens
23 the American standard of living in this tax hoax.

3 ACA and the I.R.S. hovering the main street economy

5 percent.  Instead, one percent wealth and finance
6 have conducted and won the war against the people
7 and the nation of the United States and can only
8 look to increasing their wealth and power at the
9 cost of the population.  The Fed must be
10 reorganized to fund the 50 states infrastructure
11 and industry.  The Republican party is no longer
12 the party of Lincoln who bequests to humanity a
13 nation and government of, for and by the people.
14 However, in overplaying their hand and recklessly
15 going after the population's economy, the
16 leadership may have killed the Republican party.
17 The U.S. government must spend money into the Main

2 afternoon.
3            MR. GAWFORD:  Yes.  Good afternoon
4 members of Council.  I'm here to discuss Bill
5 number 170793 which is a rezoning Bill for the
6 South Kensington area.  I'm here for myself as a
7 resident of the 1300 block of Hope Street and also
8 on behalf of other residents of that street.
9            The 1300 block of Hope Street is
10 currently a three-story street and we hope that
11 City Council can keep it that way.  In looking at
12 the proposed bill, the bill proposes to keep most
13 of the 1300 block of Hope Street as RSA-5, which
14 has a 38 foot height limit, which is a positive
15 thing.  But three parcels are being designated
16 CMX-3, which has no height limit and those three
17 parcels are 1309 North Hope, 1311 North Hope and
18 1321 North Hope and we are just hopeful that there
19 can be an amendment on the floor to amend the maps
20 for this bill to keep those parcels also as RSA-5.
21 And I would also like to submit as written
22 testimony a letter from the Townhomes of Liberty
23 North which is a community on the 1300 block of
24 Hope Street.

6            COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:  Yes.
7            COUNCILMAN JOHNSON:  Briefly.  Probably
8 one of the hardest issues I work with, Council
9 President, as relates to the second councilmanic
10 district and that's the issue of affordable
11 housing.  As I welcome development throughout my
12 councilmanic district one on the key fights is
13 making sure that long-term residents have the
14 opportunity to stay in their homes in which they
15 grew up in, and by also making sure that I
16 represent a district this reflects people's desire
17 to live there as opposed to their checkbooks and/or
18 their pocketbooks.  Currently in Congress right now
19 we're dealing with a GOP tax reform plan that
20 significantly will rollback on the level of support
21 that is provided on a federal level, particularly
22 the four percent low income housing tax credit
23 program that will allow us to develop affordable
24 housing throughout the City of Philadelphia.
25 Similarly we have the elimination of -- proposal of

4            COUNCILWOMAN PARKER:  Thank you, Mr.
5 President.  Mr. President, when I started working
6 in City Council in 1990 at the tender age of 17, I
7 had the great honor -- this is right after going
8 through the redistricting process and the District
9 had changed and the 35th Ward and moving up into
10 the lower northeast had become a part of the Ninth
11 Councilmanic District.  And I didn't even know that
12 even back then -- you know, when you're 17 you
13 don't really know who you are.  You're trying to
14 find yourself.  But I had a deep appreciation for
15 this gentleman who was -- is what I often today
16 refer to as a bit of the "A" word.  He was as
17 authentic as they come.  If you were going to do
18 anything in the 35th Ward in the Lawncrest,
19 Lawndale area, if you wanted to work on the 4th of
20 July parade, if you wanted to do anything there,
21 you wouldn't do it without the support of George
22 Naulty.  Last night I was in Lawndale, Lawncrest,
23 Burholme, Oxford Circle and all of those community
24 leaders were at a meeting that we had about the old
25 Fell School building last night.  And as I talked

1 to Bill DeVeaux, current leader there, Chris and
2 Phil, I said, you know, at least we had the
3 opportunity to experience authentic leadership that
4 didn't change.  If he gave you his word he meant
5 it, but he didn't give it to you easy.  If you were
6 going to work in the community, it wasn't about a
7 press release to get some credit for your work.  If
8 you were committed, you were going to do it at the
9 table and where the community needed it no matter
10 who knew about what you were doing.  And with that
11 being said, I want to say special thanks to the
12 family of late George Naulty on his passing.  When
13 we found out about this issue I was not here, Mr.
14 President.  If you recall I missed City Council's
15 last session because I was representing yourself
16 along with our council at the conference on middle
17 neighborhoods in Baltimore.  And so I did not get
18 the opportunity to send our regards to his family.
19 But I want to say to the people of Lawncrest and
20 Lawndale, you stand on strong shoulders with George
21 Naulty.  I was honored to have had the opportunity
22 to work with him and we're going do our best to
23 continue to serve with the same model that he did,
24 authentically.
25            Thank you, Mr. President.

1 President.  I thought I would share with my
2 colleagues and City Council a little fact about me
3 that you don't know, and that is on Saturday
4 morning I bike from my home at 18th and Locust to
5 the Navy Yard and on Sunday morning I bike from my
6 home to Broad and Allegheny and have breakfast at
7 Breakfast Heaven, which I think is in Councilwoman
8 Bass's District.  And on Tuesday I read about this
9 biker at 11th and Spruce who was killed by this
10 truck, trash truck.  And I spoke to Deputy
11 Commissioner Montanez this morning and I know I
12 joined with Councilman Squilla, this is his
13 district and he's a hundred percent behind this, we
14 need to make sure these bike lanes that we put in
15 are painted and maintained.  I know there's a lot
16 of issues, but at a minimum I want to make sure we
17 stress that they all should be maintained and
18 painted.  If we put these in in '09 and they
19 haven't been painted for a while, that's really on
20 us to make sure we maintain it.  And I will say
21 this, I'm a biker and I'm a motorist and when you
22 make a turn with a bike lane, it's treacherous
23 because you don't know if a biker is coming up, and
24 when you're a biker you don't know where the car is
25 turning.  It's something we need to solve because I
