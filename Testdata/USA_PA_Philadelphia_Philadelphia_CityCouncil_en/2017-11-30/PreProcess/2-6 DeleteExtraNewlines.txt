    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning, everyone.  Sorry to be a little tardy but we had a lot of activity this morning.  We are going to start.  We have our quorum.  I ask all guests and visitors if they would please retire behind the rail.  We can get going.
    To give our invocation this morning the Chair recognizes Pastor Shawn Hyska from the Presbyterian Church in Kensington.  He is here today as my guest.  I would ask all members, guests and visitors to please rise.
    Speaker: PASTOR HYSKA
    Good morning and peace be with you.  I want to thank the Council for this honor and particularly Council President for coming before you this morning.  Let us now go to God in prayer.  Let us pray.
    Oh loving creator God, we come before you this morning asking for your presence to be upon your servants here who serve this great City of Philadelphia.  You created all of us, oh God, in your image and in your likeness to do good, to love you as our God and ultimately to truly embody that radical love in sharing it with all of your creation, especially with our fellow brothers and sisters.  Oh God I lift up these servants of yours gathered here today that they may be granted your wisdom to discern that is not only best for the City, but what is right and just in your eyes. Give them guidance in their discernment and peace and understanding in their disagreements to seek the good for all Philadelphians so that we can continue to be a beacon to a broken world showing what true brotherly love looks like.  Strengthen, oh Lord, their collective resolves to end homelessness and help all of our citizens have a place to call home.  To ensure all Philadelphians have access to healthy and nutritious food.  To strengthen all of our youth and guarantee that they receive the highest quality education and opportunities that they deserve.  To protect and provide care and support services for all of our seniors.  To eradicate guns and drugs and get them off of our streets.  To preserve our land's history and green spaces and to continue to open our city borders and provide radical hospitality for all visitors and new residents and in particular, those seeking sanctuary.  Lord God, allow your illuminating light to shine upon the work about to be done here today.  In the power of your holy name we pray.  Amen.
    (Amen.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you so much, Pastor.  Council will be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE

    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREENLEE

    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE

    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Ayes have it and the journal is approved.
    The next order of business is requests for leave of absence and the Chair recognizes Councilman Henon.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN HENON
    Thank you, Mr. President.  On behalf of the majority there are no requests of leaves of absence today.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes Councilman O'Neill.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN O'NEILL
    Thank you, Mr. President.  On behalf of the republicans there are no requests for leaves of absence.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Chair thanks the gentleman.  At this time I would like to dispense with the regular order of business and I would like to thank everyone who has taken time out of their busy day to come down to witness their government in action.  We genuinely appreciate you coming down.  We hope your stay here today is a knowledgeable one but more importantly a pleasurable one, so much so that you come back again.  So again, thank you so much for your participation in today's session.
    At this time the Chair recognizes Councilman Jones who will present a resolution recognizing Rhonda Willingham, president and founder of Menzfit.  Would Ms. Willingham and those accompanying her please join the councilman at the podium.  And we have this runway presentation.  And joining Councilman Jones we have Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown, Councilman Green, Councilwoman Gym and Councilman Henon, Councilman Taubenberger and Councilwoman Quinones Sanchez.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    So you can learn a lot about your colleagues when they're exercising their alter egos on the runway.  Car Dee "G" back here who won.  All of them who participated, motorcycles and -- you learn a lot about your colleagues when you do these kinds of charitable events.  And I wanted to thank all of them who participated in Who Wore It Best on the runway and those who came who did not participate on the runway but contributed with their treasury such as President Clarke, such as Councilwoman Blackwell who is an champion for homeless people and also Councilman Domb who is a kinder, gentler capitalist.
    So I want you to know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not about who wore it best.  It is about who needs it the most.  The day before we did our affair, Councilman Johnson did a workshop and hearing on gun violence prevention.  At that we took a deeper dive into some of the causes of gun violence and at its core is poverty.  At its core are people who do not have jobs.  So the day of the fashion show afterwards and with all the hoopla, the next morning me and Captain Jack Jones, who is my dog, do our constitutional walk in the morning and I was reminded why it's not about who wore it best, but who needs it most.  I ran into a young man at 53rd and Ukling.  He was posted up.  And for those of you who don't know urban vernacular that means he's standing on the corner with his colleagues.  He was there and he said Congressman Jones.  I said no, no, no, no, no.  Councilman. And so he pulled himself away from his colleagues, pulled me to the side and his head was on a swivel, which means he's constantly in alert of any danger, police or competitors that he has.  You can always tell one of those boys like Councilman Johnson when their head is on a swivel.  So he says to me he does not like his life-style, but he felt trapped. That he worked a minimum wage job for long hours, had two children and at the end of the paycheck he had just enough maybe to buy clothes and food and felt as a man head of his household less than.  I looked him up and down.  You know, my head on a swivel because I'm at 7:15 in the morning hanging out with these guys noticed that he was poorly dressed, missing a tooth, pants hanging down.  And it wasn't that he was dressed down, because so was I.  It was that he didn't know.  He was unaware of his dress and how in an interview that it's totally unacceptable.  So that's why I support Menzfit, because if you don't know what you don't know you can't do better.  If you don't know not to dress for the job you have but to dress for the job you want, you'll never get there.  So Rhonda Willingham has done this for 10 years straight.  She deserves our support, those young men, those 1200 or so that she has saved deserve our support and it's not about who wore it best.  It is about who needs it most.  So therefore, recognizing, honoring Rhonda Willingham, president and founder of Menzfit for aiding in the employment of thousands of men across the City of Philadelphia, hosting the annual City Council Who Wore It Best Fashion Show whereas Menzfit is a nonprofit organization that strives to influence positive change within community by providing financial literacy and career development services, along with professional interview attire, this mission is to assist low income men with long-term rewarding employment and.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Now I'd like to congratulate this year's winner, Councilman Curtis Jones.  Although the people may say something different.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    It's not a popular vote.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Whereas the organization originated in Washington D.C. in 2001. In June 2007 Menzfit opened a location in our City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Effectiveness.  The Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency noticed Menzfit advocacy endeavors and funded their move to Philadelphia with a $250,000 grant and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN QUINONES SANCHEZ
    Whereas Menzfit was founded by Rhonda Willingham, a Philadelphia native.  Before starting the organization Willingham worked at the Department of Labor with the Clinton/Gore administration. Serving as an appointee, Willingham had a focus on public affairs and community outreach.  She is a recipient of Philadelphia's own WDAS FM Radio's Women of Excellence award and she was named a local hero when receiving Bank of America's Neighborhood Excellence Award, and whereas in Philadelphia Menzfit has helped more than 6100 men compete for jobs which have created almost 54 million dollars in taxable income.  The organization is not only a nonprofit but a movement to support underrepresented men living in low income inner cities and helping them realize and exercise their greater personal liberty and --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Whereas Menzfit offers workshop series with various focuses such as business etiquette and communications, diversity awareness and tips on how to get through an interview with ease.  Their wide range of services allows clients to excel in the professional world while obtaining self-sufficience.  And the winner of the ladies.  The ladies champion on fashion.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    Is Helen Gym this year.
    Whereas Menzfit also hosts several events across the city to raise money to aid in their efforts to get men employed.  One of those events is, as you have already heard, Who Wore It Best, a wonderful entertaining evening fashion show that features models from Philadelphia City Council, Menzfit 2016 Fashion Show featured our council members Jones, Green, Oh, Squilla, Henon and Councilman Johnson.  The 2017 fashion show did feature styles from the women of Philadelphia City Council and to the 2017 winner, Councilwoman Gym.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Whereas job hunting is extremely challenging for most people, however, it is more demanding when a job applicant lacks confidence or is unable to present what is considered an acceptable business image for employment.  Menzfit had proven to be the leading Philadelphia organization of its kind by taking an active and innovative role in assisting the underserved population, especially in this increasingly competitive job market.  Now therefore be it.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN HENON
    Resolved by the City Council of the City of Philadelphia that hereby recognizes and honors Rhonda Willingham, president and founder of Menzfit, for aiding in the employment of thousands of men across this City and for hosting the annual Philadelphia City Council Who Wore It Best Fashion Show, which I did not win. Further be resolved that a copy of this resolution be presented to Rhonda Willingham and Menzfit as further evidence of the sincere admiration and gratitude of this legislative body.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And the chair recognizes Ms. Willingham for remarks.
    Speaker: MS. WILLINGHAM
    Wow.  This is exciting.  As many times as I have come to City Council meeting I never thought that I would be standing up here in front of you to talk about something that is very, very dear to my heart, is actually my ministry which is Menzfit.  And I'm so thankful and thrilled and grateful.  And I know I speak for the rest of the team and the members of the board of directors for Menzfit when I say thank you not only to the City Council members here that participated this year and last year.  Also, I want to thank Council President Darrell Clarke.  I want to thank the mayor.  He also came to our event and is also a supporter of ours, so I wanted to make sure that I recognized everyone.  Kenyatta Johnson has been just a wonderful advocate for Menzfit and I'm looking forward to working with those council members that I have not built an intimate relationship with but I'm looking forward to doing that as we move forward into 2018.  We have got a lot of things planned for next year and you have heard from the council folks on this stage about the number of men that we have suited, the number that we have helped.  The guys that we work with come from homeless shelters, they come from job training programs, they come from Welfare to work programs, some of them are veterans.  But a large majority of our clients are returning citizens and that's a population that most people typically don't work with and it's been difficult for them to get a second chance.
    We talk about a second chance, but in all actuality it's very hard for them to get employment.  So one of the focuses of our program for next year is that we will be focusing heavily on the returning citizens.  So we're looking at doing some things within the Department of Corrections where we will actually be going into some of the state correctional facilities and starting our workshops 60 to 90 days before gentlemen are released so that we can give them -- so we really can give them a hand up and not a hand down as they prepare to leave prison.  So we're excited about that.  And I'm just thrilled to be here.  I'm a little girl from West Philly, born and raised.  So when I started Menzfit back in Washington one of the first cities on our expansion tour was obviously my home city, Philadelphia.  And I'm so happy.  I'm thrilled.  Thanks again to everyone up here for honoring Menzfit and really recognizing the good work that we do.  We all are our brother's keeper.  So thank you very much.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Council will be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you and again, congratulations.
    At this time the chair recognizes Councilman Johnson who will present a resolution honoring the Philadelphia Sunday Sun with Joseph Mondesire, Catherine Hicks and those accompanying them please join the Councilman at the podium.
    And joining Councilman Johnson, we have Councilwoman Parker, Councilwoman Blackwell, Councilwoman Bass, Councilman Green and Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown and Councilwoman Gym.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    It was 1996.  I had just graduated from Mansonville University receiving a degree in criminal justice, with dual minors in philosophy and sociology and made a personal commitment to come back to my neighborhood of Point Breeze South Philadelphia to improve the quality of life for the neighbors of which I grew up with.  And I had an opportunity one day while I was doing some volunteering political work, saw a young man who had slick hair and a cowboy hat on and some cowboy boots and saw him speaking truth to power about the issue of police brutality.  This is a gentleman who advocated for criminal justice reform before it was the progressive thing to do. This was a gentleman who advocated around the issue of youth gun violence before it became a slogan. And so today I am truly honored and privileged to recognize in honoring the life of Jerry Whyatt Mondesire and the founding of the Philadelphia Sunday Sun for its 25th anniversary.  He was a social activist, a civil rights activist and always advocated for all things regarding social justice. And so if you knew Mr. Mondesire, if you was his friend -- you definitely didn't want to be on the other side and being one of his enemies.  And so I had the good pleasure of being one of his friends and having a chance to learn some of his wise counsel during my run for City Council and he invited me up to the radio station a couple times and would give me some insight around why it was so critically important that I continue to make sure there's a voice for those who I was going to be representing when I arrived in City Council, those needed a voice in the second councilmanic district.
    So the resolution reads honoring and recognizing the Philadelphia Sunday Sun and its founder, Jerry Whyatt Mondesire, on the occasion of the Sun's 25th anniversary.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN PARKER
    And whereas the Philadelphia Sunday Sun is a weekly newspaper dedicated covering local and national stories that impact the African American community in Philadelphia.  Since its founding in 1992, the Sun has grown into a nationally respected news outlet while staying true to its mission of connecting Philadelphia's African American community and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BASS
    Whereas, the Sun was the brainchild of J. Whyatt Mondesire who owned and played an active role in the paper's publication until his death until 2015.  Trained as a journalist at the City College of New York, Mr. Mondesire joined in the historic 1969 campus takeover that sought successfully to increase diversity in the college's enrollment.  After college, Mr. Mondesire began his professional journalism career with the Baltimore Sun with the quality of his work garnering increasing national attention and earning the young journalist a position within the Philadelphia Inquirer.  After his arrival in Philadelphia, Mondesire became a leading voice for diversity within the City's news rooms helping to cofound the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists in 1973 and.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Just wanted a point of privilege to say to his beautiful wife and son, as an Asian American woman in Philadelphia, Jerry Mondesire was a mentor, a friend, a fellow warrior who exhorted and embraced so many diverse people into the civil rights movement and into building a broader message.
    Whereas after several years covering local politics and rising to the rank of assistant editor on the Inquirer's city desk, Mr. Mondesire accepted a position with Congressman William H. Gray, III, eventually serving as the Congressman's chief of staff.  Mr. Mondesire became involved with a variety of political and social causes.  Notably working to craft the ball that levied sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.  And --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Like many of the people up here, I remember my good friend Jerry and his 7:30 a.m. calls often when I was actually calling him back when I was taking my son to school.  A few years ago I had the opportunity to purchase one of his hats during a Philadelphia Association Black Journalist auction, scholarship auction.  So I keep his hat in my office as a reminder of his 7:30 calls.
    After Congressman Gray's retirement in 1991, J. Whyatt Mondesire began again to channel his passion for community activism through his work in journalism.  In 1992 Mondesire founded the Philadelphia Sunday Sun as an outlet for news and opinions that impacted the City's African American community and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    Whereas, as the City of Philadelphia joins the Sun in celebrating its 25 anniversary, the paper continues to build upon the legacy of its founder J. Whyatt Mondesire.  Today the Philadelphia Sun remains to be one of the most impactful news outlets in the City of Philadelphia and serves as a model for African American owned and operated newspapers across the country.  Now therefore --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    Now therefore know that Jerry was also a father, and I got to know him well when he would come to pick up his little daughter Jennifer from the dance class where she was one of my students.  So his social justice and his deep love for his children is really unparalleled.  And with that we resolve that the Council of the City of Philadelphia hereby honors and recognizes the Philadelphia Sunday Sun and the rich legacy of social justice it's founder J. Whyatt Mondesire leaves on the occasion of the Sun's 25th anniversary.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And the Chair recognize Mr. Mondesire and Ms. Hicks for remarks.
    Speaker: MS. LAVELLE
    Thank you.  Boy, I tell you, hearing all that it just brings back a lot of memories.  But I want to thank Councilman Johnson for this opportunity, all of Council, Council President, I'm just so humbled.  On behalf of our staff and management of the Philadelphia Sunday Sun, we are just so thankful to receive this, we are humbled and really thankful.  25 years, that's a long time.  Jerry started this paper as a voice of the community.  He wanted the opportunity to tell the stories of the community through the paper to give that opportunity to all the neighborhoods that may not have that opportunity in mainstream news media.  So we strive to continue to do that. I will strive along with his son, Joseph, who is here along with me to ensure that your stories continue to be in our paper.  We ask that you continue to support us.  I thank all my family and friends and our Sun staff who is here standing with us.  But we ask you to continue to support the paper through subscriptions, through advertising and through just letting us know what stories you want told.  Thank you.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: MR. MONDESIRE
    Good morning.  25 years, that's a long time to be putting up with that man.  So I understand -- I'm first and foremost grateful to the staff because, you know -- I mean, I know you all were doing it for a check, but I mean, that's still a long time and a lot of patience that you had to deal with, that you had to persevere through.  So I'm first and foremost grateful for you all and I'm also grateful for the people that buy this paper and read this paper on a weekly basis.  If it weren't for you all we wouldn't be up here.  There would be nothing to acknowledge if people didn't spend that money and that time investing in what we presented as a paper and as a media outlet.  So I'm truly grateful. Again, I'm humbled as well eternally.  And I really can't thank everyone enough for this opportunity and -- I really owe it to you all to keep this paper going and to grow it because one thing that I have learned throughout this time is that accuracy and timeliness are truly essential to being a successful media outlet, so that's what we're going to continue to strive for and -- I mean, that's what it is.  The so thank you very much.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Council be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And, again, congratulations.  Thank you.
    The next order of business is communications and the chair requests -- we have one more?  Sorry.  We appear to have an additional presentation.  Thank you.
    We have one more presentation.  And would like to recognize Councilman Domb.  A resolution recognizing Bernard "Bud" Newman.  Ask Councilman Domb to please come forward.  Joining Councilman Domb, we have Councilwoman Gym, Councilwoman Reynolds Brown, Councilwoman Parker, Councilman Taubenberger, Councilwoman Bass, Councilman Green, Councilman O'Neill, Counselman Henon and more importantly, Mr. Newman.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    I'm going to start off by just saying we're honoring today Bud Newman, who really has done an amazing job as president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia.  And when I thought about Bud, I looked up a quote that I had remembered from Winston Churchill that he exemplifies and that is, we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.  And what you're going to hear today from all of my colleagues is how much Bud, Judy, his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren have given, including a fact that he probably won't tell you and that is as a past president of the Jewish Federation, him and his family have made the largest endowment, eight-figure gift, to the Federation to help others in Philadelphia.  Pretty amazing.  Pretty amazing.
    Let me start with the resolution recognizing and honoring Bernard "Bud" Newman, immediate past president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia for his stewardship to the organization and service to the Jewish community of Greater Philadelphia.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    And whereas for more than a century, the Jewish Federation has worked tirelessly to convene the community, encourage and steward the generosity of donor and make grants to meet critical needs and.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN HENON
    And point of personal privilege, I want to congratulate Bud Newman.  They happen to be a business owner and long supporter of the residents and underserved communities of Northeast Philadelphia for many, many, many, many years employing those who need it and deserve second chances personally, personally firsthand in his selection of employment opportunities, and I want to thank him and Judy because that leadership has demonstrated how he operates as a successful business owner, land owner and part of the community in Northeast Philadelphia.
    Whereas the Jewish Federation serves vulnerable populations, facility community engagement and promotes Jewish life and learning. And --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN TAUBENBERGER
    Whereas under Newman's leadership, the Jewish Federation's financial resources have grown and dollars have been strategically invested into programs that most effectively address the community's needs and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Whereas, Mr. Newman and his dynamic professional team set the goal of making the Jewish Federation a more inclusive place and community engagement became one of their highest priorities.  And --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN O'NEILL
    My own personal privilege, he was Buddy at the time but he gave me my first job in the summer of 1966.  And we reconnected a couple times.  But it was the hardest job I ever had, and if you ever need an incentive to go to school so you don't have to work that hard, get a job up at Newman Paper and you'll see real work.  Thanks, Buddy.
    Whereas Bud Newman and his team dedicated themselves to building and strengthening partnerships with individuals and organizations throughout the community.  And --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN PARKER
    Whereas, in addition to Mr. Newman's leadership and commitment to the community, Mr. Newman and his family made a generous contribution to the Jewish Federation to assist in providing for the dozens of Jewish identity building, educational, social service and Israel-related programs and institutions, both local and global that the federation supports each year and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BASS
    Whereas, Bud Newman is also committed to the City of Philadelphia and its thriving business community as he is the president of Newman & Company, a century-old family business located in Philadelphia that is Pennsylvania's leading recycler and supplier of rigid cardboard and --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN TAUBENBERGER
    Whereas, Mr. Newman is also committed to the environment and providing for those in need as he maintains a farm in New Hope and distributes that produce from his farm to the Mitzvah Food Project to feed those in need and --
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Whereas, the Jewish Federation has thrived and expanded over the past three years under the outstanding leadership of Bud Newman and --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN QUINONES SANCHEZ
    We are so grateful for heros like Mr. Newman and his selflessness and endless willingness to help others in the community at large have made a positive impact and we honor him for his contributions to our city now and therefore.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Be it resolved that the Council of the City of Philadelphia hereby recognize and honors Bernard "Bud" Newman, immediate past president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia for his stewardship to the organization and his service to the Jewish community of Greater Philadelphia.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you. And the chair recognizes Mr. Newman for remarks.
    Speaker: MR. NEWMAN
    Thank you all.  Thank you, Council President Clarke.  Special thanks to Councilman Domb and all of those who cosigned.  I certainly am humbled and grateful for this recognition.  For me it has been a wonderful experience, especially in the City of Brotherly Love for which I believe so strongly we all are together.  To have had the opportunity to be at the helm of the Jewish Federation has given me much greater insight into the needs of many more than Jewish people.  This city has welcomed our Jewish federation and all that it does with open arms. This city has superb citizenry.  Its people are open and willing and anxious to do for each other. The world and the rest of our country needs to recognize that.  This City Council is an unusual group who we are trying very, very hard to do that which we do microcosmically in the Jewish community and to them I send and give my praise and thanks. For my wife, Judy, standing behind me, I always recognize that I wouldn't be here without her because without her support it wouldn't happen. Without the support --
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: MR. NEWMAN
    Without the support of so many people in the Jewish Federation who are sitting to my left who have taken the time of this day to be here as friends and professionals, my humble thanks to all of you.  God bless you and let us continue to work together.
    (Applause.)

    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    Thank you, Mr. President.  While today I speak as someone who has always feared of learning how to become a bike rider, I have always fully respected the physical fitness benefits it brings, and in 2014 approached this as a public policy matter because I embraced the environmental benefits as well.  The record should reflect that interest on this Council started in June 2014 where I introduced a bill authorizing our City to plan and operate a bicycle sharing program.  Since then we have passed collectively over seven pieces of legislation on or about bikes, bike sharing and today given several recent incidents in the news and having listened carefully to Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell learned what's happening in her district around bikes, it's time for us to reexamine with concerned stakeholders how we can learn to coexist and reduce the number of those that are being harmed by bikes. So I look forward to, I'm sure, robust discussion between bike coalitions, interested communities, including churches who are trying to figure out how we can coexist with the good news around bikes and bike sharing.  And so with that, Mr. President, I thank you.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilwoman.  That will be on today's final pass's calendar.

    Thank you.
    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    A nonprivileged resolution requesting the Mayor of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the Governor of Pennsylvania to act to restore control over the Philadelphia Parking Authority and its revenues to the City of Philadelphia.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Chair recognizes Councilman Oh.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN OH
    Thank you very much, Council President.
    In 2001, the General Assembly took over the City's on-street parking functions by taking over the Parking Authority.  Simply they changed the appointment of the Parking Authority board from being that done by the Mayor to that done by the Governor.  The reason that they used in court as to why they had the authority to take over a municipality's parking function, on-street parking function which is unconstitutional according to Article three, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution was the claim that they were held responsible for funding the School District of Philadelphia and, therefore, they had to fund the school through the Parking Authority.  And so Act 22 required that the Parking Authority contribute 45 million dollars per year to the School District of Philadelphia, which if that had been done would have provided over the last 16 years 720 million dollars to the Philadelphia School District.  It has not.  After enacting Act 22, the general assembly provided additional duties and responsibility to the Parking Authority within the City of Philadelphia and those funds go to a separate account, non-city accounts.  We actually don't know how much money that is.
    In 2004 when the cooperation agreement which the city and PPA entered was about to expire, the general assembly passed Act 9, which extended the agreement by 10 years, taking it to 2004 -- or taking it from 2004 to 2014.  But in July 2012, the general assembly passed the July 2012 statute not extending the agreement because the agreement was going to expire in 2014, but simply enacted legislation that the City's on-street parking would be administered and enforced by the Philadelphia Parking Authority.  That is unconstitutional.  And so since 2004 and into the future, the Philadelphia Parking Authority exists under the legal claim that it funds our School District.  In June of 2018, the SRC will be dissolved.  The City will be responsible for funding the school entirely with a shortage of state funds.  With that, I would ask that the Governor, the legislature and our Mayor act to return the administration, the control and the funding of the Philadelphia Parking Authority back to the City of Philadelphia.  I will note that I did introduce Bill 160844 to withdraw the City's authorization to the Parking Authority of the City functions, which we can do, but hopefully we can resolve this.  On the other hand, I will say I will find it very difficult to approve any additional tax increases, property, business or otherwise if we have not made an attempt to regain control and revenues that are generated within our City to fund our School District and City.  Thank you very much.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilman.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And that will be on next week's calendar.  That concludes our introduction of bills and resolutions.  And our next order of business is reports on committee and the chair recognizes Councilman Henon.  Full report from the Committee of the Whole.

    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    Joe Dennahell, commenting on 170683A and 170878.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good afternoon.
    Speaker: MR. DENNAHELL
    Good morning.  This is an official decree of the people and as such requires immediate action remedy.  Every week Council, Mayor and others transfer private property to government, probably illegally.  Last meeting Council spoke endlessly about how it supports civil rights.  Nothing is more primary than the God-given right to be secure in your houses, persons and effects.  Why is Council, Mayor and others denying numerous constitution laws failing to perform a known duty or task by denying due process and remedy?  The Mayor recently called out President Trump as a bully and his family didn't raise him right.  Would a firefighter be proud of his son that would violate those constitutional laws to give upwards of a hundred million taxpayer dollars, Federal taxpayer dollars to build a mall on my stolen home.  PA Constitution, Article 1, Section 11, every man for an injury done to him in lands, goods or person shall have remedy by due course of law, right and justice administered without cost, denial or delay.  The FBI and Justice Department are required to investigate, prosecute missing, misused hundreds of billions federal taxpayer dollars given to Philadelphia.  The Constitution laws require immediate remedy of this breach of law, breach of close, breach of fiduciary duty. Your oath of office requires you that or face prison.  42 USC 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987.  18 USC 241, 242, 2381, 2384.  PA Constitution Article 1, Sections one through 11.  26 PA CSA 703, 705, 708, 709, 712, 713, 716 and other laws listed in SCOTUS 1589 65.  141330, 144056.  I call for the Federal and Commonwealth governments to perform their constitutional obligations to investigate and prosecute all involved in the theft and illegal transfer of my home 1038 West Wyoming Avenue.  The denial of God-given 42 USC 1982 property rights for 23 years as egregious extraordinary oath violating and requires immediate remedy.  A just cover must obey the rule of law, this color of law. Government must have its charge of government revoked until a constitutionally compliance government is installed.  Public servants cannot refuse their sworn duty any more than a fireman can refuse to fight fire.  The sovereign people require the Constitution laws be enforced.  Jail is required for all who violate those laws.  I remind Council, it takes a lot of cooperation to create and allow monument corruption.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you for your testimony.
    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    Clark King commenting on 171022.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good afternoon.
    Speaker: MR. KING
    Good afternoon, President. Good afternoon, Council members.  Thank you for your time.  I'd like to state that the -- I'd like to start by saying that the tax on the president are harmful, especially when they're irrational or dishonest.  Having said that, I would like to state my support for Councilman Johnson's resolution here.  I believe that the Americans are facing a tax reform hoax.  A functioning Congress would go after the missing and unaccounted for stolen trillions of money which the Federal Reserve Bank has supported, not work to give the almighty one percent and the great U.S. super transnational corporations a tax break in the hope of job creation.  The great U.S. corporations are now paying an effective two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half percent tax rate.  Job creation under this criteria should have happened decades ago.  Congress appears to be still dedicated to the Wall Street system that drives a hundred million Americans into poverty.  Poverty is the actual national security crisis.  Our U.S. money system has been subverted and all but privatized.  The Fed is still serving the banker speculators.
    The U.S. Treasury and the Fed must retrieve the unaccounted for and stolen trillions with the goal of leaving the monetary financial system stabilizing United States and funding the redevelopment of North America.  Congress threatens the American standard of living in this tax hoax. It is not acceptable to permit the liquidation of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  Not acceptable to shrink or eliminate programs that serve the poor and the powerless.  We still have ACA and the I.R.S. hovering the main street economy that Congress was supposed to untax the lower 80 percent.  Instead, one percent wealth and finance have conducted and won the war against the people and the nation of the United States and can only look to increasing their wealth and power at the cost of the population.  The Fed must be reorganized to fund the 50 states infrastructure and industry.  The Republican party is no longer the party of Lincoln who bequests to humanity a nation and government of, for and by the people. However, in overplaying their hand and recklessly going after the population's economy, the leadership may have killed the Republican party. The U.S. government must spend money into the Main Street economy so that people will be able to purchase a decent standard of living, run their businesses and pay their debts and taxes.  It's a national priority. Thank you.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you for your testimony.
    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    Peter Gawford commenting on 170793.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good afternoon.
    Speaker: MR. GAWFORD
    Yes.  Good afternoon members of Council.  I'm here to discuss Bill number 170793 which is a rezoning Bill for the South Kensington area.  I'm here for myself as a resident of the 1300 block of Hope Street and also on behalf of other residents of that street.
    The 1300 block of Hope Street is currently a three-story street and we hope that City Council can keep it that way.  In looking at the proposed bill, the bill proposes to keep most of the 1300 block of Hope Street as RSA-5, which has a 38 foot height limit, which is a positive thing.  But three parcels are being designated CMX-3, which has no height limit and those three parcels are 1309 North Hope, 1311 North Hope and 1321 North Hope and we are just hopeful that there can be an amendment on the floor to amend the maps for this bill to keep those parcels also as RSA-5. And I would also like to submit as written testimony a letter from the Townhomes of Liberty North which is a community on the 1300 block of Hope Street.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you. Thank you for your testimony, sir.
    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    There are no other speakers on the public comment list, Mr. President.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE

    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    Thank you, Mr. President.  I move for the adoption of the resolution.

    (Aye.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Those opposed?

    Mr. Decker, 171022.
    Speaker: MR. DECKER
    A resolution calling on Congress to reject the GOP tax plans, which eliminate or shrink programs that promote housing affordability.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Chair recognizes Councilman Johnson.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Can I say a few remarks, Council President, before I call for the adoption of the Resolution?
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Want to speak on it?
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Yes.  Yes, sir.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Yes.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Briefly.  Probably one of the hardest issues I work with, Council President, as relates to the second councilmanic district and that's the issue of affordable housing.  As I welcome development throughout my councilmanic district one on the key fights is making sure that long-term residents have the opportunity to stay in their homes in which they grew up in, and by also making sure that I represent a district this reflects people's desire to live there as opposed to their checkbooks and/or their pocketbooks.  Currently in Congress right now we're dealing with a GOP tax reform plan that significantly will rollback on the level of support that is provided on a federal level, particularly the four percent low income housing tax credit program that will allow us to develop affordable housing throughout the City of Philadelphia. Similarly we have the elimination of -- proposal of the elimination and cutbacks in the Community Development Block Grant Program, as well as Home Investment Partnership Program.  You know, it's totally disheartening for them even considering on rolling back such initiatives that provide resources that allow us to have vibrant neighborhoods throughout not only the City of Philadelphia but also on this particular country. So I just want to ask for a yay from all of my colleagues in support of this particular resolution.
    I move for the adoption of the Resolution.
    (Duly seconded.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    It's been moved and properly seconded.  All those in favor say aye.
    (Aye.)

    (No response.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And speeches on behalf of the majority?  Chair recognizes Councilwoman Parker.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN PARKER
    Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, when I started working in City Council in 1990 at the tender age of 17, I had the great honor -- this is right after going through the redistricting process and the District had changed and the 35th Ward and moving up into the lower northeast had become a part of the Ninth Councilmanic District.  And I didn't even know that even back then -- you know, when you're 17 you don't really know who you are.  You're trying to find yourself.  But I had a deep appreciation for this gentleman who was -- is what I often today refer to as a bit of the "A" word.  He was as authentic as they come.  If you were going to do anything in the 35th Ward in the Lawncrest, Lawndale area, if you wanted to work on the 4th of July parade, if you wanted to do anything there, you wouldn't do it without the support of George Naulty.  Last night I was in Lawndale, Lawncrest, Burholme, Oxford Circle and all of those community leaders were at a meeting that we had about the old Fell School building last night.  And as I talked to Bill DeVeaux, current leader there, Chris and Phil, I said, you know, at least we had the opportunity to experience authentic leadership that didn't change.  If he gave you his word he meant it, but he didn't give it to you easy.  If you were going to work in the community, it wasn't about a press release to get some credit for your work.  If you were committed, you were going to do it at the table and where the community needed it no matter who knew about what you were doing.  And with that being said, I want to say special thanks to the family of late George Naulty on his passing.  When we found out about this issue I was not here, Mr. President.  If you recall I missed City Council's last session because I was representing yourself along with our council at the conference on middle neighborhoods in Baltimore.  And so I did not get the opportunity to send our regards to his family. But I want to say to the people of Lawncrest and Lawndale, you stand on strong shoulders with George Naulty.  I was honored to have had the opportunity to work with him and we're going do our best to continue to serve with the same model that he did, authentically.
    Thank you, Mr. President.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilwoman.
    Chair recognizes, Councilwoman Reynolds Brown.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    Yes, Mr. President.  We take great pride in our office of embracing young people, both high school students and college students and work with them carefully to help them gain experience so that they can begin to build and grow careers.  This morning I want to share with my colleagues that we are experiencing the departure of Helena Rudolph who is a master of environmental studies freshman at the University of Pennsylvania.  We want to thank her for her work and we hope we have armed her with becoming the next environmental czar.
    Thank you, Mr. President.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilwoman.  Please stand up.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Congratulations and thank you for your wonderful, wonderful support.
    Chair recognizes Councilman Domb.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Thank you, Council President.  I thought I would share with my colleagues and City Council a little fact about me that you don't know, and that is on Saturday morning I bike from my home at 18th and Locust to the Navy Yard and on Sunday morning I bike from my home to Broad and Allegheny and have breakfast at Breakfast Heaven, which I think is in Councilwoman Bass's District.  And on Tuesday I read about this biker at 11th and Spruce who was killed by this truck, trash truck.  And I spoke to Deputy Commissioner Montanez this morning and I know I joined with Councilman Squilla, this is his district and he's a hundred percent behind this, we need to make sure these bike lanes that we put in are painted and maintained.  I know there's a lot of issues, but at a minimum I want to make sure we stress that they all should be maintained and painted.  If we put these in in '09 and they haven't been painted for a while, that's really on us to make sure we maintain it.  And I will say this, I'm a biker and I'm a motorist and when you make a turn with a bike lane, it's treacherous because you don't know if a biker is coming up, and when you're a biker you don't know where the car is turning.  It's something we need to solve because I think it's a major problem.  So I just want to bring that to everyone's attention.  But more importantly, I want to make sure we have all these bike lanes painted out so that you can at least see the lines.  Thank you.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilman.  Chair recognizes Councilman Green.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Thank you, Council President.  I just want to remind my colleagues -- I think all of you have a flier on your desk regarding tomorrow's Polar Plunge.  We are working with the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania.  As chair of the Council Committee on Disabilities, I am pleased to be plunging once again tomorrow, along with my colleagues Councilman Squilla, Oh, Taubenberger, Jones and Henon.  Any other Council members that would like to join us tomorrow afternoon at 12:00 at Drexel University, you can join us in the Polar Plunge.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you, Councilman.
    That concludes our speeches on behalf of the majority and minority and with that the Chair recognizes Councilwoman Reynolds Brown for a motion to adjourn.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN REYNOLDS BROWN
    Thank you, Mr. President.  I move that City Council stand adjourned until Thursday, December 7, 2017 at 10:00 a.m.
    (Duly seconded.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Thank you. It has been moved and properly seconded that the Council stand adjourned until Thursday, December 7, 2017, 10:00 a.m.  All those in favor say aye.
