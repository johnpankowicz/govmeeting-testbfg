    {"speaker":"PASTOR NOVALES","said":"    Good morning, City Council and guests and visitors.  I pastor, as was mentioned, a powerful little church in -- a powerful church in Tacony called City Reach Philly.  I'm honored to stand in this great place of decision-making alongside great men and women of influence who have great purpose.\n    I believe that everyone in this Chamber has more things in common than we have differences.  I believe that each of us has pledged to do the best of our ability, that each of us represent others, that each of us want more for our city, that each of us have been created to make a difference, that each of us have been commissioned to be public servants.\n    Each of us have a great responsibility to make difficult decisions which have a lasting effect on our city.  Each of us have been given a distinct amount of authority, and the 13th Chapter of the Book of Romans reminds us today that the authority that we carry has been given to each of us by God, for it says let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.  The authorities that exist have been established by God himself.\n    So I would challenge each of you to remember that united we stand, divided we fall; that we would remember that God is a God of unity; that regardless of our personal preferences and opinions, we need each other.  You need me as much as I need you.  This city needs your best, my best, and that together we can make a difference.\n    Today I stand before you, each of you, in humility, for I represent the God of peace, of love, hope, unity, life, and life abundant.\n    Let us pray.\n    God, you are amazing, you who give us the breath of life, you who hold the answer to every question, the solution for every problem.  We stand before your authority this morning.\n    I ask that we would consider your word, your truth, your power as decisions are made that affect your city; that today's decisions will not be decisions that please man, but that they would please you; that we would stand firmly on the truth, for it is the truth that sets us free.\n    I pray your favor, your peace, your love over every heart in this room; that your presence will be felt in this place; that you would remind us all that we need you in our city; that you don't see our ethnicity or socioeconomic status or our differences.  On the contrary, you see sons and daughters, some who are far from you and others who passionately follow you.\n    You love us all the same, and I pray that every heart in this place would come to know you as the king and Lord that you are; that we would receive the freedom that has already been paid for on the cross.\n    So today I pray God's favor, his goodness in this house.\n    City Council, remember that God is for you.  He is not against you.  And I pray that no weapon formed against us shall prosper, for God has not given us a spirit of fear or timidity, but of power, of love, and self-discipline.  And so it is in his name, the name that is above all names, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, that I pray this morning saying thank you and amen.\n    God bless you.\n    (Amen.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

Schwartz was Council President, and he would sit up there lording over this chamber with an iron fist, and the perception was that whatever Frank Rizzo wanted, Council President Schwartz almost invariably was willing and able to deliver.\n    Then came the utterly unsuccessful Charter change vote in 1978 and Abscam in 1980 and Philadelphia politics went into a new era, and this Council had its Jackie Robinson moment when Joe Coleman became President of City Council, and so a whole new era of Philadelphia politics was underway.\n    I would like to introduce my wife, Amy.

And I don't know that Amy would want me to say this, but Amy does exhibit partisanship, but not aligned to republicans or democrats.  She is aligned to the students and to the kids of the Radnor Township community.  So that is her partisanship, and I'm just incredibly proud of you and I just wanted all these folks to meet you.\n    (Applause.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}
,
    {"speaker":"MR. GARDNER","said":"    So, you know, I'm blown away here, and thank you so much for this honor, but I must concede that I was just a little hesitant when I heard about this.  I don't know that I am entirely comfortable receiving praise from elected officials, because it is our job to keep you accountable to the taxpayers and to point out when you are succeeding and when you are failing in your mission to serve the public good. So I'm trying to figure out how to get my hands around this here this morning.  So let's just say that this morning you are succeeding spectacularly and leave it at that.\n    Seriously, the fact that you would honor a news person speaks to the fact that there is at this moment a mutual respect for the institutions that we represent.  Sadly, that is not something that we can take for granted these days, as the media is under attack like we have never seen before, and I believe strongly that we must all take responsibility for our work and when we fail, that is on us.  But when the legitimacy of the press is under constant assault from the very quarter that is supposed to, more than any other quarter, respect and protect the freedom of the press and the First Amendment, that is worrisome to me.\n    We're living in a time when I occasionally like to remind myself of what Thomas Jefferson once said, that if he had to choose between, quote, a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, that I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.  And I presume, I hope justifiably, that he would have felt the same about news on television.\n    I cannot accept your tribute without explaining something about the culture of Action News.  Individual honors at Channel 6 mean little, except within the concept of our collective effort, and I think we have long understood something that the Philadelphia Eagles say that they are learning this year, that we care little about individual achievement and that our success can be measured only in terms of how it contributes to our effort as a team to serve the viewers of the tri-state area.\n    So I can't thank you enough for this without pointing out that from my point of view, you are really showing appreciation today for our entire organization that has long held excellence and fairness and consistency as our primary goals.\n    No organization -- and I'm sure you will all agree with this -- no organization can thrive without outstanding leadership.  So I want to introduce you to our two primary leaders, Bernie Prazenica, who is President and General Manager of Channel 6, and Tom Davis, who is the News Director.  Is there a vice presidency attached to that? Okay.  Who is Vice President and Director of News at Channel 6, and they run the show.\n    (Applause.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}
,
    {"speaker":"MR. GARDNER","said":"    They absolutely run the show.\n    So there is another reason why I was a little uncomfortable coming here today.  And this will wrap up what I have to say.  I have seen you bestow honors like this on individuals who are retiring.  In fact, my former colleague and very dear friend Dave Roberts -- and I imagine many of you will remember this -- was here to accept your good words and your good wishes as he ended his extraordinary career at Channel 6. So, frankly, I wonder whether you got some bad information, because I have no plans to retire and --\n    (Applause.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

    {"speaker":"MS. CHRISTIANSEN","said":"    Good afternoon.\n    Good morning, and thank you. My name is Marybeth Christiansen.  I am the State Legislative Directive of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. I want to thank Councilman Kenyatta Johnson for sponsoring this resolution in support of State Senate Bill 501.\n    Our organization is all volunteer.  We are non-partisan.  We are single issue.  We're dedicated to preventing the epidemic of gun violence in America.\n    We are the largest gun prevention organization in the country. We have over four million members across 50 states, and we work with local, state, and federal officials for commonsense solutions to gun violence that respect the Second Amendment, and State Senate Bill 501 is one of those commonsense measures.  So we applaud you, Councilman, for passing a resolution to support this bill.\n    State Senate Bill 501 was introduced by a republican, Tom Killion of Delaware County.  It has bipartisan support, including that from our proud Philadelphia congregation.  Our co-sponsors include Senators Hughes, Haywood, Farnese, Street, Sabatina, and Williams.  This bill has been endorsed by the State District Attorney's Association, the State Chiefs of Police Association, and the FOP, and we hope that we can add the City Council's support to 501.\n    Why do we need the bill?  Well, for over 20 years, federal law has required that convicted domestic abusers and those under a final protection from abuse orders be prohibited from holding firearms, but that is not the case in Pennsylvania.  In Pennsylvania, those under a final protection from abuse order do not need to turn in their guns.  It's up to the courts, and historically our courts have ordered surrender of firearms in only 14 percent of the cases.\n    Those convicted of a crime of misdemeanor domestic violence do have to turn in their firearms, but Pennsylvania gives them 60 days to do so, a 60-day grace period to turn in your firearms. And in Pennsylvania, when those guns finally are turned in, it's up to the abuser, not the court, it's up to the abuser who gets to hold those weapons.\n    So State Senate Bill 501 would finally bring Pennsylvania in line with federal law, and it would require that within 24 hours of a conviction for domestic abuse misdemeanor or being placed under a final protection from abuse order, the abuser turns over his firearms to the police or to a licensed law enforcement dealer.\n    So we urge the Council to pass this bill.  We'd remind you -- and you probably know from reading the news that the failure to have these provisions in place in Pennsylvania has had fatal results.  We're wearing a button in honor of two-year-old Michael Ayers.\n    Am I out of time?  I think I'm out of time.\n    Please pass State Senate Bill 501.  Thank you very much for your consideration.\n    (Applause.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

    {"speaker":"MR. DANIHEL","said":"    This is an official decree of the people in writ of mandamus quo warranto and, as such, requires immediate action and remedy.\n    Every week Council, Mayor, and others transfer private property to government, probably illegally.  Have oath, Constitution, and law violators achieved what the Japanese empire could not do 76 years ago?  Stealing the home of one of the sovereign people of the United States.  Eleanor Roosevelt spoke 76 years ago:  We are the free and unconquerable people of the United States.\n    How this government by the people and for the people allow oath, Constitution, and law violators to screw the people.  Why is Council, Mayor, and others violating oath, Constitution, and laws by denying due process remedy opposing trial by jury?\n    The FBI and Justice Department are required to investigate and prosecute numerous oath, Constitution, and law violations.  The FBI and Justice Department are required to freeze federal funds until hundreds of millions of missing federal taxpayer dollars are accounted for.  FBI and Justice Department have wide latitude to use the RICO Statute to round up groups of officials who collude to steal taxpayer money and violate oath, Constitution, and laws.\n    Four score and many years ago, Jefferson, Lincoln, and others predicted that the United States would be destroyed from within by oath, Constitution, and law-violating officials.  The Constitution and laws require immediate remedy of this breach of law, breach of close, breach of fiduciary duty.  Your office requires you to act or face prison.\n    42 USC 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 18 USC 241, 242, 2381, 2384, PA Constitution, Article I, Sections 1 through 11, 26 PA CSA 703, 705, 708, 709, 712, 713, 716, and other laws listed in SCOTUS 15-8965, 14-1330, 14-4056 appear violated.\n    I call for the federal and Commonwealth governments to perform their constitutional obligations to investigate and prosecute all involved in the theft and illegal deed transfer of my home, 1038 West Wyoming Avenue.  The denial of God-given 42 USC 1982 property rights for 23 years is egregious, extraordinary, oath-violating, and requires immediate remedy.\n    A just government must obey the rule of law.  This color of law government must have its Charter to govern revoked until a constitutionally compliant government is installed.\n    Public servants cannot refuse their sworn duty to act any more than a fireman can refuse to fight a fire.  The sovereign people require Constitution and laws be enforced.  Jail is required for all who violate oath, Constitution or law.\n    I remind Council, it takes a lot of cooperation to create and allow monumental corruption.\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

    {"speaker":"MR. BUSSIE","said":"    Good afternoon, Council.  So today -- it's afternoon, right?  It's after 12:00.\n    So today the Auditor General released its findings on his audit of the Parking Authority, and I am doing my best -- and I'm glad Councilman Squilla came back, and I really wish Council President Clarke was here, because I'm doing my best to stay calm.  Because the Auditor General was kind of outraged at the press conference.  He was refraining from using certain language.  He was so outraged about what's going on in the Parking Authority, about the 900 hours of comp time for somebody getting paid over $250,000 a year, accumulating 900 hours of comp time, the $77 million that didn't go to the School District because of mismanagement and vacation time and the games they play at the Parking Authority.\n    I'm outraged because, in my opinion, you are not outraged, right?  We stand up here and we're so damn calm and so collected about fighting for our people and we try to be such gentlemen, but the problem is, there's people hurting out there.  When they get they car taken, you can't go to work.  You can't feed your family.  Like this is -- I just can't understand you guys can't champion this goddamned fight.  I can't understand why you can't champion this fight.  Like this is -- so I take off because other community leaders can't take off to be here, the Mel Wells, the Anton Moores.  They can't keep taking off to come down here to spend three minutes to be goddamned polite and talk about issues that are facing our community.\n    We need you guys to champion this cause.  Like I'm on your side.  All you guys, I'm on your side.  I consider you my team.  I consider us in your corner.  We want to back you, but you got to fight the commonsense damn fight.\n    This fight with the Parking Authority, when you read this report, you all should be outraged at this report, and for O'Neill to say I'm voting on every bill but that, how can y'all let this goddamned, this daggone coward, this gosh-darn traitor to Philadelphia just say he not going to say yes to the daggone bill and take back the Parking Authority?  Even the Attorney General, who ain't from Philly, said that they should take back the damn Parking Authority, and the fact that my friends in Council won't fight like hell for the people in Philadelphia is outrageous.\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

I am in support of Bill 171072 introduced by the champion of the Parking Authority take-back takedown, and we appreciate the Councilman at-large who has taken on this fight and consistently stayed focused in the reference to the Parking Authority. He now has more ammunition in reference to the audit that was just given out in a press conference downstairs that all of y'all should have been at, where the Auditor says the Parking Authority has been raping this city for years, that $77.5 million that should have been turned over to the school in the past five years has not, due to the Parking Authority exquisite taste in time management and property.\n    So the Parking Authority has been stealing from you, from us, from taxpayers.  There should be no other utterance in reference to the Parking Authority take-back.  Nobody else should sit around and say we got to talk about it.  There's no more talk in reference to that.  So when you get up there and you hold the kids in front of you like cowards, like the Mayor said, the City -- the school person here at the hearings for Jannie Blackwell Bill 160111 and threw up the kids, we do it for the kids, you find out that the Parking Authority is not doing anything for the children of this city.  So they can't use that as the shield that they use to cover themselves in reference to what they do.\n    They have been raping this city for five years, and we are outraged, because we came down here to support Jannie Blackwell Bill 160111 and the Parking Authority came here and came with nothing, came with absolutely nothing other than the School District flunky to say, oh, it's for the schools.  Now we find out they have did nothing for the schools.\n    So it's up to y'all to be as outraged as we are.  Parking Authority has a meeting on the 15th at 10:00 a.m., and we plan to be there blasting.  We will be here blasting also if y'all don't figure out and do what need to be done. Take the Parking Authority back.  We got our schools.  We need to fund it, and we need to do it now.\n    (Applause.)\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

    {"speaker":"MR. KING","said":"    Good afternoon, Council President and thank you, Councilmembers.  I am here in support of Councilman Henon's resolution urging the President, Congress, and all relevant federal offices to continue to protect net neutrality and open Internet services.\n    The public domain is constantly encroached upon by the private sector. The narrative, despite the reality, is that the private sector can run any organization better than public agencies and institutions.\n    Free speech is also an issue here in this modern era.  Corporate power has put tremendous pressure on the truth, the facts and with the power of characterizing the actual reality we live in, undermining our democracy, the principles of our democratic republic.\n    It's reported that Google now censors its customers, clients, and visitors to their site.  So we see in the end large corporations matter and everyone else looks bewildered.  These accusations greatly diminish the platform that allows people to speak, to access facts, knowledge and understanding of the world we live in.\n    I think Philadelphia should investigate in order to expand the commons, if you will, implementing a search engine, and it may be able to be done through its business development facilities.\n    It is disturbing that political leadership is not looking for the public's input.  They're not listening to the voice of the people.  The Internet came from the U.S. government, most of its technology from NASA.  So the Internet has become a great beehive of valuable brain power, influencing the political, education, science, markets, and economy.\n    So this necessary communication platform cannot be privatized, owned, and controlled.  I thank Councilman on his efforts.\n    In addition, I'd like to say that the City Council communicate to our leaders in the federal government that they must retrieve $40 trillion stolen money.  The Fed must be reorganized. Austerity must be condemned in whatever disguise.  The U.S. government must spend money into the main street economy so that people will be able to purchase a decent standard of living, run their businesses, and pay their debts and taxes to effect actual economic activity.  It's the national priority.\n    Thank you.\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}

I want to thank Councilman David Oh and Councilwoman Blackwell on all their work around the PPA, and I look forward to reading the report and what it will mean for when we begin to have the conversation about the School District and local control.\n    I wanted to bring up two other very important issues.  The first I'll title \"We Believe You,\" and I want to thank the women of Council, in particular Blondell Reynolds Brown and the rest of the women of Council, who together joined in a statement around sexual harassment. And I wanted to let women and men know that we believe them and I'm outraged at the continuing stories and saddened by the reality that so many hostile workplaces exist, whether it's the halls of Congress, news rooms, corporations, and recently we've heard some stories about our local non-profits.\n    We have a lot of work to do in this area, but the men and women should know we believe them and they need to tell their story.\n    And then I want to end with giving folks an update on Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican diaspora across the country is lobbying Congress this week. I want to thank all of the local folks, Unidos PA for PR and PA for PR and all our partners, AT&T, American Airlines, PECO.  Locally we've raised $300,000. We've shipped 800,000 pounds of goods, and we've adopted 2,000 families in Puerto Rico with solar lights, tarps, and water filtration systems.  Everything was needed and everything was appreciated.\n    All of us can help Puerto Rico by helping and joining us in calling our Senators and our Congress people to make sure that Puerto Rico is not further impacted negatively.  With all of the problems of the tax bill that is being debated in Congress, this further hurts Puerto Rico in that it will treat Puerto Rico as a foreign nation, and as a result of that, it will impose a 20 percent excise tax on top of everything else that's going on.  So affordable housing, whatever, imagine Puerto Rico's rebuild with a 20 percent surcharge.  And it saddens me because Florida and Texas are receiving all of the supported needs, and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to be punished.  And that's why on Monday in the Mayor's Reception Room at 10 o'clock, Puerto Rican and other Latino elected officials from across Pennsylvania will join together in calling on our congressional delegation to help Puerto Rico.\n    Puerto Ricans, if they feel hopeless in Puerto Rico -- the most efficient way is to help them there -- they will come to the United States and they will vote against those people who voted against them.\n    Thank you, Mr. President.\n","section":null,"topic":null,"showSetTopic":false}
