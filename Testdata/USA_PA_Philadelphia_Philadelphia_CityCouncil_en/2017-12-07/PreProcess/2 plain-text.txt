2              COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:  Good
3    morning.  We're getting a very late
4    start, so we'd like to get moving.  I'm
5    going to ask everyone, visitors to retire
6    behind the rail.  If the members will
7    take their seats, we'll have our
8    invocation.
9              And to give our invocation this
10    morning, the Chair recognizes Pastor Mark
11    Novales of the City Reach Philly in
12    Tacony.  He is here today as the guest of
13    Councilman Bobby Henon.
14              I would ask all guests,
15    members, and visitors to please rise.
16              (Councilmembers, guests, and
17    visitors rise.)
18              PASTOR NOVALES:  Good morning,

21    little church in -- a powerful church in
22    Tacony called City Reach Philly.  I'm
23    honored to stand in this great place of
24    decision-making alongside great men and
25    women of influence who have great

2    purpose.
3              I believe that everyone in this
4    Chamber has more things in common than we
5    have differences.  I believe that each of
6    us has pledged to do the best of our
7    ability, that each of us represent
8    others, that each of us want more for our
9    city, that each of us have been created
10    to make a difference, that each of us
11    have been commissioned to be public
12    servants.
13              Each of us have a great
14    responsibility to make difficult
15    decisions which have a lasting effect on
16    our city.  Each of us have been given a
17    distinct amount of authority, and the
18    13th Chapter of the Book of Romans
19    reminds us today that the authority that
20    we carry has been given to each of us by
21    God, for it says let everyone be subject
22    to the governing authorities, for there
23    is no authority except that which God has
24    established.  The authorities that exist
25    have been established by God himself.

2              So I would challenge each of
3    you to remember that united we stand,
4    divided we fall; that we would remember
5    that God is a God of unity; that
6    regardless of our personal preferences
7    and opinions, we need each other.  You
8    need me as much as I need you.  This city
9    needs your best, my best, and that
10    together we can make a difference.
11              Today I stand before you, each
12    of you, in humility, for I represent the
13    God of peace, of love, hope, unity, life,
14    and life abundant.
15              Let us pray.
16              God, you are amazing, you who
17    give us the breath of life, you who hold
18    the answer to every question, the
19    solution for every problem.  We stand
20    before your authority this morning.
21              I ask that we would consider
22    your word, your truth, your power as
23    decisions are made that affect your city;
24    that today's decisions will not be
25    decisions that please man, but that they

2    would please you; that we would stand
3    firmly on the truth, for it is the truth
4    that sets us free.
5              I pray your favor, your peace,
6    your love over every heart in this room;
7    that your presence will be felt in this
8    place; that you would remind us all that
9    we need you in our city; that you don't
10    see our ethnicity or socioeconomic status
11    or our differences.  On the contrary, you
12    see sons and daughters, some who are far
13    from you and others who passionately
14    follow you.
15              You love us all the same, and I
16    pray that every heart in this place would
17    come to know you as the king and Lord
18    that you are; that we would receive the
19    freedom that has already been paid for on
20    the cross.
21              So today I pray God's favor,
22    his goodness in this house.
23              City Council, remember that God
24    is for you.  He is not against you.  And

15              For four decades here in

17    us, entertained us, fascinated us, and
18    always enlightened us as the anchor of
19    WPVI Channel 6 Action News.  Generations

3    stories in 40 years of television
4    journalism.  He's a pro's pro and one of
5    the most respected and iconic local news
6    anchors in the country.  He may have been
7    born and raised in New York, but Jim
8    Gardner belongs to Philadelphia now and
9    forever, and this resolution cements
10    that.

12    Gardner for his hard work and dedication

10    this Council has taken in the last six
11    weeks.
12              When I first came to
13    Philadelphia, George X. Schwartz was
14    Council President, and he would sit up
15    there lording over this chamber with an
16    iron fist, and the perception was that
17    whatever Frank Rizzo wanted, Council
18    President Schwartz almost invariably was
19    willing and able to deliver.
20              Then came the utterly
21    unsuccessful Charter change vote in 1978
22    and Abscam in 1980 and Philadelphia

2    Council, and so a whole new era of
3    Philadelphia politics was underway.
4              I would like to introduce my
5    wife, Amy.  I witness the legislative
6    process here, but Amy knows far better
7    than I what the legislative process
8    really is.  She is a member of the Radnor
9    Township School Board.
10              (Applause.)
11              MR. GARDNER:  And if you think
12    there is -- you know what I'm going to
13    say.  If you think there is, you know,
14    some political back and forth here,
15    attend a suburban school district school
16    board meeting and you will see that in
17    action.  And I don't know that Amy would
18    want me to say this, but Amy does exhibit
19    partisanship, but not aligned to
20    republicans or democrats.  She is aligned
21    to the students and to the kids of the
22    Radnor Township community.  So that is
23    her partisanship, and I'm just incredibly
24    proud of you and I just wanted all these
25    folks to meet you.

3              MR. GARDNER:  So, you know, I'm
4    blown away here, and thank you so much
5    for this honor, but I must concede that I
6    was just a little hesitant when I heard
7    about this.  I don't know that I am
8    entirely comfortable receiving praise
9    from elected officials, because it is our
10    job to keep you accountable to the
11    taxpayers and to point out when you are
12    succeeding and when you are failing in
13    your mission to serve the public good.
14    So I'm trying to figure out how to get my
15    hands around this here this morning.  So
16    let's just say that this morning you are
17    succeeding spectacularly and leave it at
18    that.
19              Seriously, the fact that you
20    would honor a news person speaks to the
21    fact that there is at this moment a
22    mutual respect for the institutions that

2    like we have never seen before, and I
3    believe strongly that we must all take
4    responsibility for our work and when we
5    fail, that is on us.  But when the
6    legitimacy of the press is under constant
7    assault from the very quarter that is
8    supposed to, more than any other quarter,
9    respect and protect the freedom of the
10    press and the First Amendment, that is
11    worrisome to me.
12              We're living in a time when I
13    occasionally like to remind myself of
14    what Thomas Jefferson once said, that if
15    he had to choose between, quote, a
16    government without newspapers or
17    newspapers without a government, that I
18    should not hesitate a moment to prefer
19    the latter.  And I presume, I hope
20    justifiably, that he would have felt the
21    same about news on television.
22              I cannot accept your tribute
23    without explaining something about the
24    culture of Action News.  Individual
25    honors at Channel 6 mean little, except

2    within the concept of our collective
3    effort, and I think we have long
4    understood something that the
5    Philadelphia Eagles say that they are
6    learning this year, that we care little
7    about individual achievement and that our
8    success can be measured only in terms of
9    how it contributes to our effort as a
10    team to serve the viewers of the
11    tri-state area.
12              So I can't thank you enough for
13    this without pointing out that from my
14    point of view, you are really showing
15    appreciation today for our entire
16    organization that has long held
17    excellence and fairness and consistency
18    as our primary goals.
19              No organization -- and I'm sure
20    you will all agree with this -- no
21    organization can thrive without
22    outstanding leadership.  So I want to
23    introduce you to our two primary leaders,
24    Bernie Prazenica, who is President and
25    General Manager of Channel 6, and Tom

3    there a vice presidency attached to that?

8              MR. GARDNER:  They absolutely
9    run the show.
10              So there is another reason why
11    I was a little uncomfortable coming here
12    today.  And this will wrap up what I have
13    to say.  I have seen you bestow honors
14    like this on individuals who are
15    retiring.  In fact, my former colleague
16    and very dear friend Dave Roberts -- and
17    I imagine many of you will remember
18    this -- was here to accept your good
19    words and your good wishes as he ended
20    his extraordinary career at Channel 6.
21    So, frankly, I wonder whether you got
22    some bad information, because I have no
23    plans to retire and --

4    and the students, and I was blown away,
5    because this -- I visited now 34 schools
6    since I've been elected, and the
7    leadership of the principal is the key to
8    the school.  Parents have his cell phone
9    number.  He was telling me they call him
10    on Friday nights or on the weekends.  He
11    makes himself available.  And it reminds
12    me of an expression that I feel his
13    school embodies and, that is, no one
14    cares how much you know until they know
15    how much you care.  And this principal

2    solutions to gun violence that respect
3    the Second Amendment, and State Senate
4    Bill 501 is one of those commonsense
5    measures.  So we applaud you, Councilman,
6    for passing a resolution to support this
7    bill.
8              State Senate Bill 501 was
9    introduced by a republican, Tom Killion
10    of Delaware County.  It has bipartisan
11    support, including that from our proud
12    Philadelphia congregation.  Our
13    co-sponsors include Senators Hughes,
14    Haywood, Farnese, Street, Sabatina, and
15    Williams.  This bill has been endorsed by
16    the State District Attorney's
17    Association, the State Chiefs of Police
18    Association, and the FOP, and we hope
19    that we can add the City Council's
20    support to 501.
21              Why do we need the bill?  Well,
22    for over 20 years, federal law has
23    required that convicted domestic abusers
24    and those under a final protection from
25    abuse orders be prohibited from holding

2    firearms, but that is not the case in
3    Pennsylvania.  In Pennsylvania, those
4    under a final protection from abuse order
5    do not need to turn in their guns.  It's
6    up to the courts, and historically our
7    courts have ordered surrender of firearms
8    in only 14 percent of the cases.
9              Those convicted of a crime of
10    misdemeanor domestic violence do have to
11    turn in their firearms, but Pennsylvania
12    gives them 60 days to do so, a 60-day
13    grace period to turn in your firearms.
14    And in Pennsylvania, when those guns
15    finally are turned in, it's up to the
16    abuser, not the court, it's up to the
17    abuser who gets to hold those weapons.
18              So State Senate Bill 501 would
19    finally bring Pennsylvania in line with
20    federal law, and it would require that
21    within 24 hours of a conviction for
22    domestic abuse misdemeanor or being
23    placed under a final protection from
24    abuse order, the abuser turns over his
25    firearms to the police or to a licensed

3    go to the School District because of
4    mismanagement and vacation time and the
5    games they play at the Parking Authority.
6              I'm outraged because, in my
7    opinion, you are not outraged, right?  We
8    stand up here and we're so damn calm and
9    so collected about fighting for our
10    people and we try to be such gentlemen,
11    but the problem is, there's people
12    hurting out there.  When they get they
13    car taken, you can't go to work.  You
14    can't feed your family.  Like this is --
15    I just can't understand you guys can't
16    champion this goddamned fight.  I can't
17    understand why you can't champion this
18    fight.  Like this is -- so I take off
19    because other community leaders can't
20    take off to be here, the Mel Wells, the
21    Anton Moores.  They can't keep taking off
22    to come down here to spend three minutes
23    to be goddamned polite and talk about
24    issues that are facing our community.

3    you guys, I'm on your side.  I consider
4    you my team.  I consider us in your
5    corner.  We want to back you, but you got
6    to fight the commonsense damn fight.
7              This fight with the Parking
8    Authority, when you read this report, you
9    all should be outraged at this report,
10    and for O'Neill to say I'm voting on
11    every bill but that, how can y'all let
12    this goddamned, this daggone coward, this
13    gosh-darn traitor to Philadelphia just
14    say he not going to say yes to the
15    daggone bill and take back the Parking
16    Authority?  Even the Attorney General,
17    who ain't from Philly, said that they
18    should take back the damn Parking
19    Authority, and the fact that my friends
20    in Council won't fight like hell for the
21    people in Philadelphia is outrageous.

5    management and property.
6              So the Parking Authority has
7    been stealing from you, from us, from
8    taxpayers.  There should be no other
9    utterance in reference to the Parking
10    Authority take-back.  Nobody else should
11    sit around and say we got to talk about
12    it.  There's no more talk in reference to
13    that.  So when you get up there and you
14    hold the kids in front of you like
15    cowards, like the Mayor said, the City --
16    the school person here at the hearings
17    for Jannie Blackwell Bill 160111 and
18    threw up the kids, we do it for the kids,
19    you find out that the Parking Authority
20    is not doing anything for the children of
21    this city.  So they can't use that as the
22    shield that they use to cover themselves
23    in reference to what they do.

2    because we came down here to support
3    Jannie Blackwell Bill 160111 and the
4    Parking Authority came here and came with
5    nothing, came with absolutely nothing
6    other than the School District flunky to
7    say, oh, it's for the schools.  Now we
8    find out they have did nothing for the
9    schools.
10              So it's up to y'all to be as
11    outraged as we are.  Parking Authority
12    has a meeting on the 15th at 10:00 a.m.,
13    and we plan to be there blasting.  We
14    will be here blasting also if y'all don't
15    figure out and do what need to be done.

3              MR. KING:  Good afternoon,
4    Council President and thank you,
5    Councilmembers.  I am here in support of
6    Councilman Henon's resolution urging the
7    President, Congress, and all relevant
8    federal offices to continue to protect
9    net neutrality and open Internet
10    services.
11              The public domain is constantly
12    encroached upon by the private sector.
13    The narrative, despite the reality, is
14    that the private sector can run any
15    organization better than public agencies
16    and institutions.
17              Free speech is also an issue
18    here in this modern era.  Corporate power
19    has put tremendous pressure on the truth,
20    the facts and with the power of
21    characterizing the actual reality we live
22    in, undermining our democracy, the
23    principles of our democratic republic.
24              It's reported that Google now

2    visitors to their site.  So we see in the
3    end large corporations matter and
4    everyone else looks bewildered.  These
5    accusations greatly diminish the platform
6    that allows people to speak, to access
7    facts, knowledge and understanding of the
8    world we live in.
9              I think Philadelphia should
10    investigate in order to expand the
11    commons, if you will, implementing a
12    search engine, and it may be able to be
13    done through its business development
14    facilities.
15              It is disturbing that political
16    leadership is not looking for the
17    public's input.  They're not listening to
18    the voice of the people.  The Internet
19    came from the U.S. government, most of
20    its technology from NASA.  So the
21    Internet has become a great beehive of
22    valuable brain power, influencing the
23    political, education, science, markets,
24    and economy.

5              In addition, I'd like to say
6    that the City Council communicate to our
7    leaders in the federal government that
8    they must retrieve $40 trillion stolen
9    money.  The Fed must be reorganized.
10    Austerity must be condemned in whatever
11    disguise.  The U.S. government must spend
12    money into the main street economy so
13    that people will be able to purchase a
14    decent standard of living, run their
15    businesses, and pay their debts and taxes

2    Burdge, as you know.
3              I heard about affordable
4    housing.  I met with one of the Council
5    leaders yesterday and he said that we
6    need to do something for the poor, and
7    affordable housing is a start.
8              I've been on your list for PHA
9    for five years, and I'm finally getting
10    considered after five years of being on a
11    list and being on the streets.
12              We need to get this affordable
13    housing, seriously, guys.  It's something
14    that is very necessary.  Curtis said we
15    are doing better with it, but we need
16    more.  We need more.  We need something
17    to get the poor people.
18              Our city is the fifth largest
19    city, and we have the most poverty in it.
20    So we need to work for the poor people
21    and get affordable housing and really
22    work on this.
23              And, two, we need not just the
24    government to do it.  We need the private
25    sector too.  So we can work together, as

5    And I wanted to let women and men know
6    that we believe them and I'm outraged at
7    the continuing stories and saddened by

12    about our local non-profits.
13              We have a lot of work to do in
14    this area, but the men and women should
15    know we believe them and they need to

2    and we've adopted 2,000 families in
3    Puerto Rico with solar lights, tarps, and
4    water filtration systems.  Everything was
5    needed and everything was appreciated.
6              All of us can help Puerto Rico
7    by helping and joining us in calling our
8    Senators and our Congress people to make
9    sure that Puerto Rico is not further
10    impacted negatively.  With all of the
11    problems of the tax bill that is being
12    debated in Congress, this further hurts
13    Puerto Rico in that it will treat Puerto
14    Rico as a foreign nation, and as a result
15    of that, it will impose a 20 percent
16    excise tax on top of everything else
17    that's going on.  So affordable housing,
18    whatever, imagine Puerto Rico's rebuild
19    with a 20 percent surcharge.  And it
20    saddens me because Florida and Texas are
21    receiving all of the supported needs, and
22    Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
