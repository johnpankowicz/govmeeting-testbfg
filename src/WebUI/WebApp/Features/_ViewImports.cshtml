@*_ViewImports.cshtml serves one major purpose: to provide namespaces which can be used by all other views.
       In previous MVC projects, this functionality was provided by the web.config file in the Views folder.
       Since the web.config no longer exists, global namespaces are now provided by this file.

  A simple _ViewImports.cshtml file might look like this:
      @using MyProject.Web
      @using Microsoft.Framework.OptionsModel
      @addTagHelper "*, Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.TagHelpers"

  The first two lines say that we want the MyProject.Web and Microsoft.Framework.OptionsModel namespaces to be available to all views.
       If we wanted another namespace to be available, we'd simply add it here.
  The reason that we use the @addTagHelper keyword is because we need the Tag Helpers to actually execute (at some point in the page rendering lifecycle) rather than just be available to the views.
       So, we specify a tag helper namespace, and the asterisk (*) specifies that we want all tag helpers in that namespace to be used.*@
