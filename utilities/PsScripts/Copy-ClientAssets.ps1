# The client assets consist of the files in ClientApp/dist/ClientApp and
# the single "assets" folder in that location.
# Deleting the files in WebApp/wwwroot is easy. But, I tried all of the solutions for quietly deleting
# the assets folder and its contents, that I found at:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7909167/how-to-quietly-remove-a-directory-with-content-in-powershell
# All of them randomly failed, depending on where I ran the commands (in the ISE, as a pre-build task, etc).
# This seems to be because of the asynchronous way Windows executes Remove-Item.
# See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53561052/1978840
# The easiest way around this for deleting the assets folder is to:
#   1. First delete all files recursively.
#   2. Then delete all folders (non-recursively).
#   3. Then delete the assets folder.
# This solution depends on the fact that the folders in wwwroot/assets are only one level deep.
